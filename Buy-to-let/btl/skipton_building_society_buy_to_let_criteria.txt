The valuer's decision is final: no challenges will be accepted, and no refunds of valuations fees will be issued if the decision is a decline.

------------------------------------------------------------

Ground rent and other service charges must always remain at a reasonable level during the lease term. The ground rent must not exceed more than 0.1% of the property value/purchase price (whichever is lower) at the time of the application and there must be a minimum period of 10 years between any ground rent increases.
It is acceptable if the ground rent escalation is linked to the Retail Price Index (RPI) or other similar index. Compounded PRI increases are not acceptable.
Clauses providing for ground rent increases that ‘double’ (or more) the preceding level are not acceptable.
A ground rent clause which allows the ground rent charge to exceed £250 p.a. outside the M25 or exceed £1,000 p.a. inside the M25 is not acceptable unless a deed of lease variation can be obtained.

Where a Professional Consultant's Certificate is accepted in place of a new home warranty scheme, these are only acceptable on small scale developments i.e. those consisting of 15 residential units or less (either houses or residential flats).


25. New Build Incentives
------------------------------------------------------------

Builders may offer sales incentives to potential buyers to encourage them to purchase their property. An incentive is anything the builder gives or provides to the buyer in cash or goods. Typical examples are deposits (i.e. builders deposits) paid before completion and cash paid after completion - often to pay stamp duty or legal fees. As all incentives must be paid for by the builder, they can be regarded as a less transparent alternative to reducing the sale price.
Assessment of Incentives
Financial incentives of up to 5% of the purchase price or valuation (whichever is the lower) are allowed on New Build properties only and are permitted on any New Build. Any application where the financial incentive value exceeds 5% will be declined, regardless of the LTV.
Where there is a financial incentive on a BTL application the maximum LTV available will be reduced by 5% to 70% LTV.
The Customer must be able to provide a minimum of a 5% deposit (a builder deposit can be accepted in addition to this but not in place of the customer’s own deposit).
Evidence
All incentives must be declared at DIP stage. The UK Finance Disclosure of Incentives form (formally CML incentive form) is required by the valuer, which provides details and value of any incentives.Valuers take incentives into account when preparing the valuation report. Please note that all lending is always subject to a satisfactory valuation for mortgage purposes.We will work off the lower of the valuation or the purchase price.Evidence of the deposit may be requested at application stage.
The Society does not accept applications where:
The builders/vendors are paying above market value for a part exchange property.The application has any form of Vendor (Private Seller) deposit funding.

Commonhold properties are not acceptable to lend on, by the Society.


30. Unencumbered Property
------------------------------------------------------------

If the property to be mortgaged is unencumbered then we may need to carry out additional checks to confirm the ownership of the property as part of the application process. This may include asking your client(s) to visit a local Skipton Building Society branch with suitable photo ID documentation or Skipton Building Society instructing a valuer to visit the property to carry out a standard valuation. 
The Underwriter will assess the case and advise you if any additional checks are required. We won’t charge for a valuation for mortgage purposes where the property value is less than £1.5 million. If the property is worth more than this then your client(s) will be required to pay a top up fee. There may also be some additional travel fees for your client to pay if the property is off the mainland or in a remote location. 
If your client is capital raising against their unencumbered property then we would process this as a remortgage application and your client would be eligible for any product from our current remortgage range. Where the property is unencumbered it must have been owned for a minimum of 6 months.

The valuer's decision is final: no challenges will be accepted, and no refunds of valuations fees will be issued if the decision is a decline.

Photographs of supporting documents are acceptable, with the exception of Personal and Address ID documents. For further guidance please refer to our Acceptable Documents [PDF].
A completed Cash Flow document [PDF] will also be required for all Portfolio Landlord applications.
Additional documentation may be requested by the Underwriter if they feel this is necessary to process the application.

New Build Homes are acceptable providing the build is completed within 12 months of the Societies 1st mortgage offer.Properties bought off plan are not acceptable for BTL applications.We accept BTL applications up to 75%* LTV for New Build properties.

Where a Professional Consultant's Certificate is accepted in place of a new home warranty scheme, these are only acceptable on small scale developments i.e. those consisting of 15 residential units or less (either houses or residential flats).


52. New Build Incentives
------------------------------------------------------------

Builders may offer sales incentives to potential buyers to encourage them to purchase their property. An incentive is anything the builder gives or provides to the buyer in cash or goods. Typical examples are deposits (i.e. builders deposits) paid before completion and cash paid after completion - often to pay stamp duty or legal fees. As all incentives must be paid for by the builder, they can be regarded as a less transparent alternative to reducing the sale price.
Assessment of Incentives
Financial incentives of up to 5% of the purchase price or valuation (whichever is the lower) are allowed on New Build properties only and are permitted on any New Build. Any application where the financial incentive value exceeds 5% will be declined, regardless of the LTV.
Where there is a financial incentive on a BTL application the maximum LTV available will be reduced by 5% to 70% LTV.
The Customer must be able to provide a minimum of a 5% deposit (a builder deposit can be accepted in addition to this but not in place of the customer’s own deposit).
Evidence
All incentives must be declared at DIP stage. The UK Finance Disclosure of Incentives form (formally CML incentive form) is required by the valuer, which provides details and value of any incentives.Valuers take incentives into account when preparing the valuation report. Please note that all lending is always subject to a satisfactory valuation for mortgage purposes.We will work off the lower of the valuation or the purchase price.Evidence of the deposit may be requested at application stage.
The Society does not accept applications where:
The builders/vendors are paying above market value for a part exchange property.The application has any form of Vendor (Private Seller) deposit funding.

This may include asking your client(s) to visit a local Skipton Building Society branch with suitable photo ID documentation or Skipton Building Society instructing a valuer to visit the property to carry out a standard valuation. 
The Underwriter will assess the case and advise you if any additional checks are required. We won’t charge for a valuation for mortgage purposes where the property value is less than £1.5 million. If the property is worth more than this then your client(s) will be required to pay a top up fee. There may also be some additional travel fees for your client to pay if the property is off the mainland or in a remote location. 
If your client is capital raising against their unencumbered property then we would process this as a remortgage application and your client would be eligible for any product from our current remortgage range. Where the property is unencumbered it must have been owned for a minimum of 6 months.
