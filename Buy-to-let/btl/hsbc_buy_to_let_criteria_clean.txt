47. #### Type of buy to let property
============================================================

We define a Consumer Buy to Let as:A property that wasn’t / isn't being initially purchased for a specific purpose of renting (e.g previous home / inherited property / accidental landlord)We define an Investment Buy to Let as:A property that is being purchased / was originally purchased for the specific purposes of renting.


48. ### We define a Consumer Buy to Let as:
============================================================

A property that wasn’t / isn't being initially purchased for a specific purpose of renting (e.g previous home / inherited property / accidental landlord)


49. ### Affordability for HSBC BTL mortgagescan only be assessed using rental income.
============================================================

In addition to rental income coverage, we will assess personal income when making a lending decision.

Consideration will be given to your customer’s personal commitments so to ensure that the lending remains sustainable in the event of tenancy voids, or where maintenance/repair costs have been incurred.

The application may be declined if we determine that there is insufficient disposable income to support the borrowing, or if the overall exposure is too high.


50. ### Income Cover Ratio (ICR) assessment
============================================================

For basic rate tax payers, we will assess affordability based on the annual rental income, which must be equal to or greater than 125% of the annual Buy to Let mortgage payments, calculated at the stressed rate or product rate, whichever is higher. This takes into account potential future interest rate rises.

Please note that when working out whether a basic or high rate taxpayer, total income should be considered.  This should include rental income that is currently being received along with 75% of any proposed new property rental income (if a BTL Purchase application).

For higher rate tax payers, we will assess affordability based on the annual rental income, which must be equal to or greater than 145% of the annual Buy to Let mortgage payments, calculated at the stressed rate or product rate, whichever is higher.

For joint applicants, both applicants need to be a basic rate tax payer to achieve a stressed rate of 125%, otherwise 145% will be applied if one applicant is a basic rate tax payer and the other applicant a higher rate tax payer.

For applications from non-UK residents, we will assess affordability based on the annual rental income, which must be equal to or greater than 145% of the annual Buy to Let mortgage payments, calculated at the stressed rate or product rate, whichever is higher.

A further check is also required to ensure that the rental payment is sufficient to cover the mortgage payment on a capital repayment basis.

72. ### Affordability for HSBC BTL mortgagescan only be assessed using rental income.
============================================================

In addition to rental income coverage, we will assess personal income when making a lending decision.

Consideration will be given to your customer’s personal commitments so to ensure that the lending remains sustainable in the event of tenancy voids, or where maintenance/repair costs have been incurred.

The application may be declined if we determine that there is insufficient disposable income to support the borrowing, or if the overall exposure is too high.


73. ### Income Cover Ratio (ICR) assessment
============================================================

For basic rate tax payers, we will assess affordability based on the annual rental income, which must be equal to or greater than 125% of the annual Buy to Let mortgage payments, calculated at the stressed rate or product rate, whichever is higher. This takes into account potential future interest rate rises.

Please note that when working out whether a basic or high rate taxpayer, total income should be considered.  This should include rental income that is currently being received along with 75% of any proposed new property rental income (if a BTL Purchase application).

For higher rate tax payers, we will assess affordability based on the annual rental income, which must be equal to or greater than 145% of the annual Buy to Let mortgage payments, calculated at the stressed rate or product rate, whichever is higher.

For joint applicants, both applicants need to be a basic rate tax payer to achieve a stressed rate of 125%, otherwise 145% will be applied if one applicant is a basic rate tax payer and the other applicant a higher rate tax payer.

For applications from non-UK residents, we will assess affordability based on the annual rental income, which must be equal to or greater than 145% of the annual Buy to Let mortgage payments, calculated at the stressed rate or product rate, whichever is higher.

A further check is also required to ensure that the rental payment is sufficient to cover the mortgage payment on a capital repayment basis.

There is no specific order in which these applications need to be keyed/submitted, but we would expect both applications to be completed at a similar time to be able to cross reference.

Please ensure that you have correctly included the new Let to Buy mortgage payment in the onward Residential purchase application. Do not duplicate the existing Residential mortgage payment that will cease once the new Let to Buy mortgage is in place.

We will not treat the onward residential as aSecond propertywhere the current residential property is being converted to a Let to buy, therefore it is not subject to the 80% LTV cap (standard LTV limits apply).

The future rental income from the Let to buy can also be utilised within the onward residential purchase application. Please note this does not apply to unencumbered properties.

This can be evidenced from the valuation report if the Let to buy application is with HSBC UK, or a letter from the Association of Rental Letting Agents (ARLA) if the Let to buy application is with another lender.

Deceased CustomersProduct Switch - If a joint mortgage where one of the parties has passed away, you are able to complete a product switch for the remaining customer who is the surviving borrower, while the mortgage is still in joint names. Please ensure that the customer has already notified HSBC UK Mortgage Service Centre of their deceased partner.Additional Borrowing/any other changes - If a joint mortgage where one of the parties has passed away please advise the surviving borrower to contact HSBC UK to discuss any future requirements, while the mortgage is still in joint names.OverpaymentsAccess ourcalculatorsto find out how a regular or lump sum overpayment could reduce the term and interest paid on the mortgage.Lump sum and overpayments can be made at any time to our lifetime tracker mortgages.Our fixed rate and discount mortgages have an annual overpayment allowance equivalent to 10% of the principal mortgage balance at drawdown, or at the start of a new rate switch.Overpayments can be made by lump sum reductions and/or additional ad-hoc payments credited direct to the mortgage.The monthly payments will remain the same unless the customer asks us to recalculate them on their reduced mortgage balance.Alternatively, the customer can set up a flexible overpayment arrangement. If they choose this method, we will collect the overpayment in with the existing direct debit payment. The arrangement can be set up for a specific period or until further notice, your customer will need to make sure the monthly overpayments will not exceed their annual allowance in any one period.When the current rate changes, the customer will need to review the arrangement again as the standard monthly payments and allowance will be reset.At the end of the flexible overpayment arrangement the standard monthly payments will automatically be reset. This is the same if there is a change to the monthly payment date, rate or an amendment to the overpayment arrangement to a different amount. The recalculation will take into account previous overpayments, as it is calculated on the principal mortgage balance, the current interest rate and the remaining mortgage term.If a new flexible overpayment arrangement is put in place, or when the current overpayment arrangement ends, the bank will acknowledge this with a letter to the customers to confirm the new payments being collected.The overpayment allowance is reset annually on the anniversary of the drawdown, or at the start of the new rate following a switch.If your customer switches rates before this anniversary date, a new overpayment will commence from the date the new rate begins and will be calculated by using 10% of the mortgage balance at this time. An overpayment allowance is not transferable to the next overpayment period, therefore any allowance not utilised will be forfeited.The Early Repayment Charge (ERC) will only be applied to the mortgage if the customer was to exceed the overpayment allowance in any one annual period. This applies to an overpayment made by lump sum payments, ad-hoc payments or on a monthly overpayment arrangement.We cannot amend or set up the overpayment arrangement if the mortgage is in the billing cycle, this means 5 working days prior to the monthly mortgage payment being collected. If you wish to cancel this arrangement, you will need to do so at least 7 working days before the payment is due.By making overpayments, the customer will benefit from an interest saving immediately as interest is charged daily. The term of the mortgage may be reduced which can result in the loan being repaid earlier. This will only be achieved if overpayments are continually made throughout the original mortgage term.If monthly payments are reset, they are calculated over the original mortgage term/remaining term.Any projected savings as a result of overpayments are subject to change. The projections are not guaranteed as they are based on the current interest rate, the overpayments against the existing monthly payments, and the remaining term. All of these factors will change.Any changes to the interest rate, payment date, or if the overpayment arrangement stops will result in the standard payments being recalculated over the original term. We will revert to a standard monthly payment (minimum payment) following these changes.If the annual overpayment allowance is set in a leap year, the allowance will not commence on drawdown or amendment, and will instead reset the following working day.Online banking customers can view their overpayment allowance by using the overpayment screen on their mortgage account. This shows the annual allowance amount, the start and end dates for the current period and the allowance balance remaining if overpayments have been paid.Placing an application / Cancelling a caseSubmitting an Additional Borrowing, Porting or Product Switch applicationTo commence an Additional Borrowing, Porting or Product Switch application, select 'Existing customer' from thebroker portalafter logging in.For Additional Borrowing and Product Switch applications you will need to accept the customer offer document on behalf of your client to ensure the application completes.For Porting applications, receipt of the Certificate of Title (COT) auto-triggers the offer acceptance, so you do not have to manually accept it for this type of application.For further information about applications for existing HSBC UK mortgage customers, please take a look at ourFrequently Asked Questions.Cancelling a caseFor all application types you must inform us if you wish to cancel the case.Many of our processes in the application journey are now automated, therefore the case may reach completion if you do not advise us that it should be cancelled.For Product Switch applications only:On the Broker Platform, enter the application reference and use the ‘Cancel application’ option.For all other application types, please call our Broker Support Team on 0345 6005847 (Monday – Friday 9am to 5pm) if you wish to cancel a submitted application.For all Application types where a booking fee has already been paid, this will be refunded within 48 hours.PortingYou can complete a Porting application request on behalf of your customer under the following circumstances:Porting EligibilityYour customer is an existing HSBC UK mortgage customerYour customer is on a Fixed Rate, Term Tracker or Lifetime TrackerThe eligible rate will need to have at least 6 months remainingThe sale and purchase will be completed simultaneouslyIf your customer is looking to port their current product, they will need to be aware of the following exclusions which will result in their application not proceeding:Porting ExclusionsAny account in arrearsMore than six existing loan partsMore than two applicantsPorting a HSBC closed secured loanEquity buy-out (EBO)Marital DisputesWhere there is an existing application in progress (this will include a product switch application)Further InformationFor the total borrowing amount, a procuration fee of 0.4% residential and 0.5% BTL will be paid for the new lending upon completion.You will be able to complete Simultaneous Porting applications, where the existing HSBC mortgage must be repaid simultaneously with the drawdown of the new application.As a Porting application is an onward purchase you can also apply to amend details (subject to meeting eligibility criteria) such as loan term, repayment type, add on an applicant (as long as no more than 2 applicants in total) etc.Product switchingWhen completing a Product Switch application on behalf of your client you will need to accept the customer offer document to ensure the application completes.You can complete a product switch on behalf of your client under the following circumstances:Product Switch EligibilityYour client is an existing HSBC UK mortgage customerYour client is on a Fixed Rate, Term Tracker, Lifetime Tracker or Standard Variable RateIf a joint mortgage where one of the parties has passed away, you are able to complete a product switch for the remaining customer who is the surviving borrower, while the mortgage is still in joint names.

Affordability is assessed on a capital repayment basis and takes into account likely future interest rate rises.Evidencing customer expenditureAll customer stated credit and non-credit committed expenditure must be critically assessed.Credit commitments are verified, bank statements may be required in some cases.For international customers the last three months' worth of bank statements and the latest months credit card statement, where a credit card balance exists, must be provided.For affordability you will need to include all credit card balances.For any cards that are paid off in full each month, please include the highest balance during the last 1 month period as recently cleared balances may be included in our calculations.Where evidence is provided to confirm a credit card balance has been repaid in full, for a minimum of the last 3 months and the latest balance is not higher than the preceding statement balances, this can be excluded from the affordability assessment.Debts ending within 6 monthsIf an applicant can provide evidence that a commitment or ongoing cost is intended to cease within 6 months of their mortgage application, we will discount this debt from the debt/income calculation.If further clarification is needed in respect of a customer's credit commitments, we reserve the right to examine Credit Bureau information to confirm the nature and true extent of their lending exposure.Buy to Lets in backgroundOur assessment is based on the full costs associated with the Buy to Let - not just the rental income, e.g. Landlord insurance, management fees, any anticipated costs during a void period such as council tax and utilities.All rental income must be evidenced by the latest year's tax return.Tenancy agreements and bank statements showing rental income, mortgage payments and outgoings related to the Buy to Let property are only acceptable as evidence in the following cases:The customer is paying tax related to their Buy to Let income via PAYE (this will need to be evidenced via a notice of coding and/or payslips); orProperties have been purchased within the current tax year; orThe customer is not paying tax on the Buy to Let income due to their overall gross income level being less than their personal allowanceFor customers with existing Buy to Let properties who are applying to purchase/remortgage a residential property for their own use, we will also need to ensure the request 'makes sense' and that the property being purchased or remortgaged is in line with the customer's profile.Childcare and school feesPlease complete theParental leave formand upload to the application under ‘Ad-hoc’ for review by the underwriter.We consider childcare and school fees as a regular outgoing and commitment, which will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.Due to the Government changes announced on 30th October 2024, when completing a mortgage application where private school fees are applicable, you will be required to include all future costs including VAT.Lending into retirementAs part of our responsible lending policy the maximum age is dependent on the repayment type, and subject to meeting ourTerm& Lending into retirement criteria.Where an applicant is within 10 years of age 70, or their anticipated retirement age if sooner,(subject to a system maximum), we will require current income documents and also pension projections (dated within the last 12 months).The application will be assessed on affordability up to age 70, or anticipated retirement age if sooner, as well as affordability based on projected retirement income.Where an applicant is over 10 years from age 70, or their anticipated retirement age if sooner, we will require current income documents.The application will be assessed on affordability up to age 70, or anticipated retirement age if sooner. In this scenario, if the applicant is also applying for a term that will take them beyond the age of 70, or their anticipated retirement age if sooner, we will also require documents to evidence pension contributions (this can be either via a payslip or a pension statement).Interest Only (including split repayment types)If any part of the lending is Interest Only, the Interest Only policy will be applied to the whole application.Fully Funded Repayment PlanThe mortgage term must not exceed the oldest applicants 75th birthday.Example of Fully funded repayment plan: Existing savings - the value of the cash savings is at least 100% of the mortgage loan at the time of application.Non Fully Funded Repayment PlanThe mortgage term must not exceed the oldest applicants 70th birthday or anticipated  retirement age if sooner.Example of Non Fully funded repayment plan: Ad hoc capital – the accrual of earnings to reduce the mortgage balance or to build savings over the mortgage term.For more details, please seeResidential Interest Only Repayment Plans.Capital RepaymentMortgage term must not exceed the oldest applicants 80th birthday.How we assess the application;Oldest applicant is within 10 years from their 70th Birthday or anticipated retirement age (whichever is sooner):Lending on Capital Repayment that takes the oldest customer beyond their 70th birthday or anticipated retirement age (whichever is sooner) will only be considered if affordability can be evidenced to the oldest customers 70th Birthday or anticipated retirement age.Example:Oldest applicant is 63 years at the time of application.Plans to retire at the age of 70.They apply for a Capital repayment mortgage over a term of 10 years.Affordability will be assessed, on current income, to age 70.  Affordability will also be assessed on pension projections over the 10-year term.This will be assessed on the lower of earned or pension income.Let to buyWe have enhanced our policy where the applicant is converting their existing property to a Buy to Let and completing the onward residential purchase with HSBC UK.The onward residential purchase will no longer be capped at 80% LTV, nor subject to ourSecond propertypolicy. We will need to evidence the conversion of the existing residential mortgage to a Buy to Let mortgage, with a Mortgage Offer from the lender.The future rental income for the property being converted can also be utilised within the onward residential purchase application.Please note this does not apply to unencumbered properties.Where the customer is converting their residential to a Let to Buy with another lender and the onward residential purchase is with HSBC UK, we require a letter from the Association of Rental Letting Agents (ARLA) to evidence the future expected rental income.Non-simultaneous sale and completionThis will be treated as running 2 properties. Our affordability calculations will consider both mortgage balances and running costs, plus thesecond propertyandincome from employment(salary multiples) criteria will apply.Please note, only simultaneous porting is available via HSBC UK for Intermediaries, where the existing HSBC mortgage must be repaid simultaneously with the drawdown of the new application.Transitional arrangementsTransitional Arrangements (TA) were introduced by the FCA in order to protect customers from becoming a ‘mortgage prisoner’ or ‘trapped borrower’ i.e. unable to move home or change their interest following the introduction of more stringent affordability requirements.TA apply where there is a variation to a residential mortgage contract where no additional borrowing is being requested except for product fees that may have been added to the loan.TA’s only apply to existing residential HSBC UK mortgage customers. The TA policy cannot be applied to an external remortgage application, where your customer is seeking to transfer an existing mortgage from another lender without increasing their mortgage borrowing.Under no circumstance should an application which meets TA criteria be declined or turned away without being formally assessed by an underwriter. This includes where the Decision in Principle offers less than the customers current mortgage. You will need to submit the application and all supporting documentation before the application can be considered.Any customers who wish to complete a simultaneous porting application, who meet the TA criteria but are currently in arrears, will need to contact HSBC UK directly to complete these applications.Existing borrowersConsent to LetIf an existing HSBC customer wishes to temporarily let their property, please ask them to contact HSBC UK directly as they must obtain consent in accordance with the requirements of our legal charge.Members of the British Armed Forces, including Ghurkhas, who are on Active ServiceAll other applicantsApply for a period of Consent to Let appropriate to their circumstances (e.g. duration of posting away from home in the UK or overseas).Apply for Consent to Let at any point during their mortgage term.We will only approve where the letting will be on an assured shorthold tenancy (England) a Standard contract (Wales) or non-rent controlled tenancy (Northern Ireland).

Please ensure that the customer has already notified HSBC UK Mortgage Service Centre of their deceased partner.Additional Borrowing/any other changes - If a joint mortgage where one of the parties has passed away please advise the surviving borrower to contact HSBC UK to discuss any future requirements, while the mortgage is still in joint names.OverpaymentsAccess ourcalculatorsto find out how a regular or lump sum overpayment could reduce the term and interest paid on the mortgage.Lump sum and overpayments can be made at any time to our lifetime tracker mortgages.Our fixed rate and discount mortgages have an annual overpayment allowance equivalent to 10% of the principal mortgage balance at drawdown, or at the start of a new rate switch.Overpayments can be made by lump sum reductions and/or additional ad-hoc payments credited direct to the mortgage.The monthly payments will remain the same unless the customer asks us to recalculate them on their reduced mortgage balance.Alternatively, the customer can set up a flexible overpayment arrangement. If they choose this method, we will collect the overpayment in with the existing direct debit payment. The arrangement can be set up for a specific period or until further notice, your customer will need to make sure the monthly overpayments will not exceed their annual allowance in any one period.When the current rate changes, the customer will need to review the arrangement again as the standard monthly payments and allowance will be reset.At the end of the flexible overpayment arrangement the standard monthly payments will automatically be reset. This is the same if there is a change to the monthly payment date, rate or an amendment to the overpayment arrangement to a different amount. The recalculation will take into account previous overpayments, as it is calculated on the principal mortgage balance, the current interest rate and the remaining mortgage term.If a new flexible overpayment arrangement is put in place, or when the current overpayment arrangement ends, the bank will acknowledge this with a letter to the customers to confirm the new payments being collected.The overpayment allowance is reset annually on the anniversary of the drawdown, or at the start of the new rate following a switch.If your customer switches rates before this anniversary date, a new overpayment will commence from the date the new rate begins and will be calculated by using 10% of the mortgage balance at this time. An overpayment allowance is not transferable to the next overpayment period, therefore any allowance not utilised will be forfeited.The Early Repayment Charge (ERC) will only be applied to the mortgage if the customer was to exceed the overpayment allowance in any one annual period. This applies to an overpayment made by lump sum payments, ad-hoc payments or on a monthly overpayment arrangement.We cannot amend or set up the overpayment arrangement if the mortgage is in the billing cycle, this means 5 working days prior to the monthly mortgage payment being collected. If you wish to cancel this arrangement, you will need to do so at least 7 working days before the payment is due.By making overpayments, the customer will benefit from an interest saving immediately as interest is charged daily. The term of the mortgage may be reduced which can result in the loan being repaid earlier. This will only be achieved if overpayments are continually made throughout the original mortgage term.If monthly payments are reset, they are calculated over the original mortgage term/remaining term.Any projected savings as a result of overpayments are subject to change. The projections are not guaranteed as they are based on the current interest rate, the overpayments against the existing monthly payments, and the remaining term. All of these factors will change.Any changes to the interest rate, payment date, or if the overpayment arrangement stops will result in the standard payments being recalculated over the original term. We will revert to a standard monthly payment (minimum payment) following these changes.If the annual overpayment allowance is set in a leap year, the allowance will not commence on drawdown or amendment, and will instead reset the following working day.Online banking customers can view their overpayment allowance by using the overpayment screen on their mortgage account. This shows the annual allowance amount, the start and end dates for the current period and the allowance balance remaining if overpayments have been paid.Placing an application / Cancelling a caseSubmitting an Additional Borrowing, Porting or Product Switch applicationTo commence an Additional Borrowing, Porting or Product Switch application, select 'Existing customer' from thebroker portalafter logging in.For Additional Borrowing and Product Switch applications you will need to accept the customer offer document on behalf of your client to ensure the application completes.For Porting applications, receipt of the Certificate of Title (COT) auto-triggers the offer acceptance, so you do not have to manually accept it for this type of application.For further information about applications for existing HSBC UK mortgage customers, please take a look at ourFrequently Asked Questions.Cancelling a caseFor all application types you must inform us if you wish to cancel the case.Many of our processes in the application journey are now automated, therefore the case may reach completion if you do not advise us that it should be cancelled.For Product Switch applications only:On the Broker Platform, enter the application reference and use the ‘Cancel application’ option.For all other application types, please call our Broker Support Team on 0345 6005847 (Monday – Friday 9am to 5pm) if you wish to cancel a submitted application.For all Application types where a booking fee has already been paid, this will be refunded within 48 hours.PortingYou can complete a Porting application request on behalf of your customer under the following circumstances:Porting EligibilityYour customer is an existing HSBC UK mortgage customerYour customer is on a Fixed Rate, Term Tracker or Lifetime TrackerThe eligible rate will need to have at least 6 months remainingWhere the existing HSBC mortgage must be repaid simultaneously with the drawdown of the new applicationIf your customer is looking to port their current product, they will need to be aware of the following exclusions which will result in their application not proceeding:Porting ExclusionsAny account in arrearsMore than six existing loan partsMore than two applicantsPorting a HSBC closed secured loanEquity buy-out (EBO)Marital DisputesWhere there is an existing application in progress (this will include a product switch application)Further InformationFor the total borrowing amount, a procuration fee of 0.4% residential and 0.5% BTL will be paid for the new lending upon completion.You will be able to complete Simultaneous Porting applications, where the existing HSBC mortgage must be repaid simultaneously with the drawdown of the new application.As a Porting application is an onward purchase you can also apply to amend details (subject to meeting eligibility criteria) such as loan term, repayment type, add on an applicant (as long as no more than 2 applicants in total) etc.Where the current property is not being sold and the customer wishes to Port the product to a new residential purchase application, this is acceptable providing the existing mortgage will be repaid by one of the following methods: customers own funds/Remortgaging to another lender/Converting to a Let to Buy with another lender.Customers who are currently in negative equity wanting to port their existing mortgage will need to contact HSBC UK directly to complete these applications.Where an ERC is applicable and the new loan amount is less than the existing loan amount - the full ERC will be charged.

The overpayment allowance is refreshed annually on the anniversary of the drawdown or the start of the new rate following a switch, and will be based on the current balance at the time. If the customer switches rates before this anniversary date, a new overpayment allowance will commence from the date the new rate begins.If fixed or discount rate customers exceed their annual overpayment allowance for a given year, an Early Repayment Charge will be charged on the amount they have repaid over the allowance.Exit feeHSBC does not currently charge borrowers any exit fee when they fully repay their mortgage.Fee SaverOur Fee Saver deal means no booking fee and no standard valuation fee.A completion fee is payable in all buyer and package types apart from Remortgage my existing mortgage applications via HSBC UK where a fees assisted Legals only product is selected.We will cover the cost of one standard valuation where this is required by HSBC UK as part of the mortgage application.Other fees and charges may be payable to other parties including, but not limited to legal fees and charges levied by an existing lender.Legal feesThese are the fees payable to the applicant's solicitor or licensed conveyancer acting on behalf of the applicant and/or HSBC.

It is not available as a standalone Additional Borrowing application.Transfer of security:Customer has first charge residential or Buy to Let mortgage lending secured against a property which was for the purpose of purchasing that property and wishes to transfer the lending to another property they own.Repayment of contractual debt:Where a customer has a debt for which there is a contract in place stipulating the terms and conditions such as length of contract, terms of repayment etc. (For example credit card, personal loan, bridging loans, hire purchase agreement, PCP car agreement including repayment of the final or balloon payment).Repayment of shared equity:Where a customer has taken a mortgage with another lender along with a Government Help to Buy Loan or other shared equity provider and now wishes to remortgage to HSBC with additional lending to fully repay the shared equity charge. These will be processed in line with our policy on purchase of a final share of a shared ownership property.Repayment of savings:Where a customer has used their savings to purchase a property or for home improvements due to the timescales involved with the mortgage process and wishes to use secured lending to replenish their savings.DepositYou need to confirm and document the source of an applicant's deposit as we will be unable to complete the mortgage without this information.Please do not forward any form of documentary evidence regarding deposits unless specifically requested.Foreign NationalsDeposit is funded from customer’s own resources, i.e. personal savings. Gifts are not acceptable unless they are in addition to the 15 per cent deposit provided from the applicants own resources.Non-UK ResidentsDeposit is funded from customer’s own resources, i.e. personal savings. Gifts are not acceptable unless they are in addition to the 25 per cent deposit provided from the applicants own resources.Family discounted purchaseWhere the property is a discounted purchase from a family member, we will only lend up to the maximum allowable LTV of the lower of the ‘discounted’ purchase price or valuation. We will also rely on the solicitor or licensed conveyancer to satisfy themselves that the family member gifting the property is not insolvent, and to arrange suitable indemnity insurance for the full value of the property if they deem it necessary.Armed Forces concessionCustomers who are wanting to use Armed Forces Help to Buy Loan as a deposit for their mortgage will need to contact HSBC UK directly to complete these applications.Acceptable sources of depositPersonal savingsFunded from the customer's own resources.Secured borrowingFunds raised by releasing equity from another property owned by the applicant, this includes secure bridging loansGifted deposit from family member (including where protected by a Declaration of Trust)Where the deposit has been 'gifted' by a family member, the acting solicitor/conveyancer must obtain a signed letter from the donor to confirm the deposit is a 'non-refundable and an unconditional gift and that no interest is claimed in the property'.Please note – a family member is considered to be close relation defined as a spouse, domestic partner, grandparent, parent, sibling, half sibling, aunt, uncle, cousin, in law relation or step relation.If a family member is contributing towards the purchase price and wishes to protect their beneficial interest by way of a Declaration of Trust, we will need to approve this and ensure our interest in the property is protected. We will also require a Letter of Consent to be signed by the contributor.Please note: We are unable to proceed if a Declaration of Trust is to be created against a property that will be registered to a sole proprietor (property owner)Gifted deposit from occupier not named on mortgageWhere the deposit has been 'gifted' by an occupier not named on the mortgage, the acting solicitor/conveyancer must obtain a signed letter from the donor to confirm the deposit is a 'non-refundable and an unconditional gift and that no interest is claimed in the property'.We cannot accept the gifted deposit if the occupier is not a family member.Developer gifted deposit/IncentiveFinancial incentives provided by a Developer up to 5% of the property price are acceptable without impacting the property value. Where the value of a financial incentive is above 5%, the difference must be deducted from the purchase price. We can only lend up to the maximum allowable LTV of the discounted purchase price or valuation.Not acceptable sources of depositUnsecured credit facilities or personal borrowingMoney that is borrowed by the customer other than by way of a legal mortgage over property owned by them and will need to be repaid at any point in the future must not represent any element of the deposit.ConcessionaryWe can only lend up to the maximum allowable LTV of the lower of the ‘discounted’ purchase price or valuation. This will ensure that the customer(s) are contributing a deposit to the purchase rather than relying on any equity within the property to fund this.Gifted deposit not from immediate familyA deposit that is gifted that does not fall in the above acceptable categories of gifted deposit from family member or gifted deposit from occupier not named on mortgage.Vendor gifted depositAny incentives provided by the vendor should be discounted from the purchase price. We can only lend up to the maximum allowable LTV of the discounted purchase price or valuation.Please note that this is not exhaustive and a source of deposit not listed above can be considered subject to there being no element of personal borrowing (e.g. Personal Loan, other loan from a family member/third party, director's loan, Credit Card, Overdraft) or a gift from a third party not listed as acceptable.Energy Efficient HomesEEH products are available for Purchase and Remortgage applications up to £2million, and where the property has an Energy Performance Certificate rating of A or B. Please refer to theproduct finderfor our current range..To check an EPC rating, please refer to the Government website:find an energy certificate..A PEA rated property will be a new build property, PEA certificates are provided by the Developer..If the PEA certificate has limited address information please also provide the Plot Reservation form for the property (also provided by the Developer).Independent Legal AdviceIndependent Legal Advice (ILA) is the process where a person is advised by their own solicitor or licensed conveyancer, in a face to face meeting in the absence of the borrower and other interested parties, as to the consequences for them of executing a mortgage deed and agreeing to secure new borrowing on a property they own or will own.HSBC's policy is that the owner(s) of a property must be advised of the legal consequences of providing a mortgage over it to secure residential lending. This will help ensure that the bank's security is enforceable against the borrower(s) and the owner(s) of the property, that customers are treated fairly and that the bank is lending responsibly.As a result, HSBC requires ILA in the following scenarios:There is a difference of more than £50,000 between one or more individual owners the owner benefiting least will require ILAThe funds are being gifted to a third party) and the difference in benefit to the third party compared to owners is more than £50,000. In this instance ILA is required for all owners/borrowers.Exception – ILA is not required where the difference in benefit is less than £50,000, regardless of funds being used for individual owners or gifted to a third party. It is also not required where funds are for school fees for a dependent child under the age of 18.The funds are being injected into a business that is not 100% owned by the property owner/s and the difference in benefit to the business compared to the property owners is more than £50,000.Where the business is 100% owned by the property owner/s, ILA is recommended.ILA CostsThe customer is responsible for all ILA-related fees, and should consult their chosen ILA firm for the exact cost. Where ILA is mandatory and the application is going through the LMS panel, there is an additional fee payable to the LMS panel firm for the additional work associated with this.Guidance on who provides the ILAIf an LMS panel is acting for HSBC as part of the transaction, the customer must instruct a different firm to provide the ILA. LMS act for HSBC in the following applications and so a conflict of interest would result if the firm were also to provide the ILA:RemortgageUnencumbered HOLShared Ownership *Transfer of Title*We currently do not provide this specific type of mortgage through HSBC intermediary channel.The person receiving ILA can use a solicitor or licenced conveyancer who they know to provide this service or they can find one by visiting:England and Wales:http://solicitors.lawsociety.org.uk/?Pro=Truehttps://www.clc-uk.org/find-a-clc-lawyer/Scotland:http://www.lawscot.org.uk/Northern Ireland:http://www.lawsoc-ni.orgInterest onlySingle applicants requesting a residential interest-only mortgage will be required to have an annual minimum income £75,000 which must meet our income eligibility criteria below.

Additional repayment vehicles can be used for lending above this LTV)SavingsEndowmentsStocks and Shares ISAInvestmentsSale of Other PropertyIf the intended repayment plan is not a fully funded, our affordability assessment will be based on a Capital Repayment basis.For more details, please seeInterest Only Repayment Plans.We are unable to accept the following as a suitable repayment plan:Sale of current or planned main residence at the end of the termSale of commercial or overseas propertyLump sum from a personal or occupational pension scheme – because of frequent changes to pension policies and regulations which make assessment of credibility difficult.Interest Only loans are restricted to Interest Only LTV limits. However, any additional lending can be added on a Capital Repayment basis with the additional lending restricted to Capital Repayment LTV limits. Please refer toLoansection for further details.LoanThe minimum amount we can lend is £10,000. The minimum property value we accept is £50,000.There is no maximum loan amount restriction for residential mortgages, as long as the application meets all other criteria.Standard LendingSpecific Types of Property and ApplicantOffer extensionFor Purchase applications an offer extension may be requested within the last 30 days of the original offer expiry date.For new build properties the offer extension will be for 90 calendar days (from date of expiry of the original offer)For non-new build properties, the offer extension will be for 30 calendar days (from date of expiry of the original offer)Please note: this applies to new build properties only.

Under this scenario, two fees may be payable if a different rate is chosen for each loan part.PropertyAnnexe / Granny flatIn order to be considered suitable security, properties with an annexe/annexes must meet the following requirements:The size of the annexe must be proportionate in size and smaller than the main dwelling.If the annex is on a separate legal title, it will not be included in the valuation.The saleability of the main property should not be adversely affected by the presence of the annexe.Vacant possession is required purchase cases.The following criteria will NOT be acceptable:Non-residential uses for the annexe (e.g. Airbnb, guest house, commercial live/work, office or shop).If there is any evidence that the access rights to the main property run through the land in the annex title, unless a charge was also taken over the annex title.The bank will be guided by the type of valuation received and any additional guidance from the valuer (in cases where a PV has been completed).Commercial property close byWe can lend against residential properties with commercial properties close by, subject to the valuer's comments that the property is suitable security.Discounted propertiesWe can only lend up to the maximum allowable LTV of the lower of the 'discounted' purchase price or valuation. This will ensure that customers are contributing a deposit to the purchase, rather than relying on any equity in the property to fund this.Family-discounted purchaseWhere the property is a discounted purchase from a family member, we will only lend up to the maximum allowable LTV of the lower of the 'discounted' purchase price or valuation. We will also require the solicitor or licensed conveyancer to satisfy themselves that the family member gifting the property is not insolvent and to arrange suitable indemnity insurance for the full value of the property if they deem it necessary.Please note, when an applicant is purchasing a property from a family member separate legal representation is required. It is HSBC policy that the same solicitor or licensed conveyancer cannot act for both seller and buyer.FlatsThe maximum LTV borrowing on a flat is 90%. For new build flats this reduces to 85%. Ex-local authority flats have a maximum LTV of 80%.If you intend to capitalise a booking fee then the loan amount plus the added fee must remain within the LTV restrictions stated above.The above maximum LTV also only applies where the total loan size is not exceeded.Please refer to theLoansection for further information on LTV limits.In order to be considered suitable for mortgage purposes, flats must be habitable with a fully functioning internal kitchen and bathroom and with no restrictions on occupancy.Investor led properties (i.e. where the majority of the units within a building are not owner occupied) are not accepted.Buildings insurance covering the full cost of re-building the flat must be in place for the duration of the term of the mortgage.We will not normally lend where:The block is above four storeys high and there is no lift;Where the lease of the flat / maisonette does not contain adequate covenants and arrangements in respect of the common services in line with our instructions to the Conveyancer. This will form part of the conveyancing checks orThe property is in an ex-local authority high rise block with seven or more floors.Please note, while blocks of flats with more than 4 floors including the ground floor with no lift are normally considered unacceptable for mortgage purposes, some exceptions can be made. Good quality, private sector purpose build or converted blocks of flats in prestigious areas of central London or in prime city centres (where the benefits of city living outweigh the unusual market resistance to high rise blocks, exhibiting strong saleability, in excellent condition and with sustainable re-sale potential) may be considered on individual merit by the valuer.In all cases, we will require the valuer to confirm that the flat is both mortgageable and marketable.Where the valuer identifies evidence of cladding on a property, additional checks and an EWS1 (External Wall Fire Review) form may be required to determine whether the cladding material meets minimum safety standards or is defective.An EWS1 form will be required in the following circumstances:For buildings over six storeys:There is cladding or curtain wall glazing on the building orthere are balconies which stack vertically above each other and either both the balustrades and decking are constructed with combustible materials (e.g. timber) or the decking is constructed with combustible materials and the balconies are directly linked by combustible material.For buildings of five or six storeysThere is a significant amount of cladding on the building (for the purpose of this guidance, approximately one quarter of the whole elevation estimated from what is visible standing at ground level is a significant amount) orthere are ACM, MCM or HPL panels on the building* orthere are balconies which stack vertically above each other and either both the balustrades and decking are constructed with combustible materials (e.g. timber), or the decking is constructed with combustible materials and the balconies are directly linked by combustible materials orthere is cladding around the main route of escape or linking multiple floors of a building with potential to promote the spread of fire, even if less than one quarter of whole elevation.For buildings of four storeys or fewer:There are ACM, MCM or HPL panels on the building** Note: metal cladding and ACM/MCM are visually very similar, so if metal panel cladding is present an EWS1 inspection should be requested unless the valuer is satisfied that the cladding isnotACM/MCM and can fully justify their decision.Where properties have failed their EWS1/FRAEW assessment. We will consider lending on the following properties:In Wales, those covered by the Welsh Government’s funded remediation schemes.In England, if the property is to be remediated under a suitable remediation scheme or leaseholders are protected under the provisions of the Building Safety Act 2022.New to bank buy to let properties in England and Wales may be considered for lending where there is evidence, they will be fully remediated within 6 months, and it is confirmed that the leaseholder would not be liable for any costs associated with the remediation.*Note – there are currently no remediation schemes for properties of 11m/4 storeys or less.The following information may also be requested:Confirmation of any contribution that the leaseholder is liable for in respect to any proposed programme of remediation works.Confirmation of any start date for remediation works.If providing details of a remediation scheme (as above) then no EWS1 form is required.The bank will be guided by the valuer to confirm the suitability of the property for mortgage purposes.New to bank Buy to Let where remediation will not be complete within 6 months and Second Home applications are not considered suitable for the remediation scheme lending.For properties in Scotland and Northern Ireland where the EWS1 form confirms that the property does not meet minimum safety standards, the property will be deemed unsuitable for mortgage lending and we will be unable to proceed with an application.Where an EWS1 form is required in respect of the building, it should be signed by a person holding a qualification from an organisation included in the EWS-Form List of Relevant Professional Bodies.The documentation must be fully completed and be accompanied by a letter on company headed paper from the signing firm which details their area of business, qualifications and confirms they completed the form.Studio flatsThere are no restrictions on studio flats. We can lend, subject to valuer's comments that the property is suitable security.Japanese knotweedJapanese Knotweed is an invasive plant that grows rapidly and can cause structural damage to buildings and roads.Where Japanese Knotweed has not been identified within the boundaries of the property, but is present on neighbouring land within three metres of the boundary, the valuer will report this to the bank but no remediating action should be required.Where Japanese Knotweed has been identified within the boundaries of the property being mortgaged to the Bank, we can proceed where there is no visible damage to outbuildings, paths and fences. We will rely on the valuer to assess the damage or any restrictions to access which may be caused by the presence of Japanese Knotweed and to confirm whether a specialist report is required.  If so, we will require the following:A treatment plan which has been fully completed by an appropriately qualified person or company such as an accredited member of an industry recognised trade association such as the Property Care Association and the Invasive Non-Native Specialists AssociationA Completion Certificate that confirms the weed has already been fully remediated with a minimum 10 year insurance backed guarantee in placeA copy of the Completion Certificate and Guarantee are to be provided to the valuer for their confirmation that the property is suitable for mortgage security and whether there is any impact on the valuation of the propertyNote: Where the valuer confirms there is no visible damage and the property is acceptable for mortgage purposes, the presence of Japanese Knotweed could still impact the value.LocationHSBC can provide mortgages in mainland England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Scottish Isles.New buildWe define a new build property as one that will be occupied for the first time and/or has been built and completed within the last 24 months.Although we can approve mortgages on properties not yet built subject to satisfactory valuation, we will not release funds until the property has been completed. A re-inspection may be required if the surveyor advises one is necessary in their original valuation.Standard lending criteria apply subject to:A maximum 90% LTV for houses. The maximum LTV only applies where the total loan size is not exceeded as set out in theLoansection.A maximum of 85% LTV for flats The maximum LTV only applies where the total loan size is not exceeded as set out in theLoansection.If you intend to capitalise a booking fee then the loan amount plus the added fee must remain within the LTV restrictions stated above.A structural defects warranty being in place.New Build IncentivesFinancial IncentivesFinancial incentives up to 5% of the property price are acceptable without impacting property value.Where the value of a financial incentive isabove 5%, the difference must still be deducted from the purchase price for LTV purposes.Non-Financial IncentivesAny non-financial incentives offered by a builder / developer are acceptable without impacting LTV.Any incentives either financial or non-financial must still be declared.New home warranty schemes -  Structural defects warranty / insuranceIt is a requirement that where a property has been built or converted within the last 10 years (purchase application) or two years (remortgage /unencumbered additional borrowing application), it has the benefit of a suitable new home warranty (Structural defects warranty / SDW) or Professional Consultants Certificate in place from the practical completion of the property.AcceptableNew home warranty schemes:ABC+ WarrantyAdvantage HCIArk Insurance Group LtdBuild Assure New Homes/Build Assure 10Building Life Plans (BLP)Build-Zone New Home WarrantyCheckmate Castle 10 Home WarrantyGlobal Home Warranties LtdHomeproof – formerly known as Aedis Warranties LtdInternational Construction Warranties Ltd (ICW)Local Authority Building Control (LABC) New Home WarrantyNHBCOne GuaranteePremier GuaranteeProtekThe Q PolicyProfessional Consultants Certificate (PCC)A PCC is only acceptable for newly built homes within a development of no more than 10 properties.If the property is a flat or maisonette, a PCC must be available for the common parts and the structure of the building if these are part of the new build/conversion works.The professional consultant should have one or more of the following qualifications:fellow or member of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (FRICS or MRICS); orfellow or member of the Institution of Structural Engineers (F.I.Struct.E or M.I.Struct.E); orfellow or member of the Chartered Institute of Building (FCIOB or MCIOB); orfellow or member of the Architecture and Surveying Institute (FASI or MASI) (only if in conjunction with a FCIOB or MCIOB qualification); orfellow or member of the Chartered Association of Building Engineers (C.Build E MCABE or C.Build E FCABE); ormember of the Chartered Institute of Architectural Technologists (MCIAT); orarchitect registered with the Architects Registration Board (ARB).

This is because the warranty provider will not have carried out any inspections during construction, so they offer no assurance that the property was suitably constructedRetrospective PCC’s from a professional who has not supervised the project from the start and inspected the build at regular intervals are not acceptableThe latent defects policy obtainable through HBUK insurers is not a suitable policy to cover the lack of the above warranties for residential mortgage purposesNon-standard construction typesProperties constructed using non-standard or non-traditional methods maybe unacceptable for mortgage purposes or lending maybe restricted.The list below is not exhaustive. HSBC will rely on the valuer’s comments.Timber-framedTimber-framed properties constructed between 1920 and 1965 are considered unacceptable for mortgage purposes due to inferior building regulations in relation to vapour barriers.Scottwood/Swedish are also considered unacceptable for mortgage purposes.All timberDue to the unusual nature of the construction, properties made entirely from timber are usually considered restricted. We will be guided by the valuer's comments on marketability. If acceptable, they will be subject to a maximum LTV of 80%Wimpey No Fines and Laing EasiformProperties dated from 1945 onwards are acceptable, subject to the valuer's comments, at the lower LTV ratio of 80%.Bear in mind that Wimpey No-Fines properties are currently being monitored in the north of England where some deterioration has been noted. If this construction type is subsequently defined as 'defective', this could have a significant impact on the value and saleability of the property.Steel frameWater penetration and condensation can cause corrosion of the steel frame causing instability of the property. These properties are acceptable subject to a satisfactory structural engineer's report, at the lower LTV ratio of 80%.Livett Cartwright steel frames, Hawthorn Leslie steel frames with boarded finish, and BISF (British Iron and Steel Federation) are considered unacceptable for mortgage purposes.Kit-builtThe following 'kit-built' type of constructions with special architectural merit or proven long-term durability are considered restricted with a maximum LTV of 80%, subject to usual warranty provision if less than 10 years old:Huf HausPottonSkandia-HusBorder Oak (and other bulk timber kit forms)Colt/Guildway (these types are subject to an entirely satisfactory valuer statement of condition and saleability, which could be enhanced by location if they are found on larger rural or semi-rural plots)DurisolDurisol houses are accepted up to 80% LTV, subject to a satisfactory structural engineer's report. Durisol flats are considered unacceptable for mortgage purposes.Mundic blockProperties containing mundic block materials (primarily situated in Cornwall & Devon) must be tested using the screening test developed by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. The results of the test will be considered as follows:A = Suitable for mortgage purposesA/B = Restricted, acceptable at up to 80% LTV, subject to valuer's commentsB = Unacceptable for mortgage purposesC = Unacceptable for mortgage purposesBellrockLoad bearing gypsum plaster panel construction is considered unacceptable for mortgage purposes.OveragesFor new HSBC UK mortgage customers we will not provide lending where a property is subject to an overage agreement.For existing HSBC UK mortgage customers we will not accept a request for a new overage agreement, but where a property already has an existing overage agreement requests for new lending can be accepted.Part domestic / Part commercialWe can lend where the commercial element represents a minor part of the property, providing the whole property can be sold as a complete residential unit.For example:A single room used by the borrower for home-working would be acceptable.A single room used by the borrower where there will be commercial callers and/or other staff present would be considered as commercial use and would not be acceptable.We cannot provide residential mortgage facilities on a property that is used wholly for business purposes or where there are commercial buildings on the same title (for example, a holiday let/cottage).Properties bought at auctionApplications for properties purchased at auction are acceptable.Once the customer has had their bid accepted the application needs to be submitted as soon as possible so the valuation can be instructed immediately.

Applications not completed within this time frame will be cancelled.The minimum acceptable property valuation amount is £50,000.An Automated Valuation (AVM), Digital Valuation (DV), Managed Desktop Valuation (MDV) or Physical Valuation (PV) must be used to determine whether a property is suitable security for a mortgage loan.Please note that a valuation is carried out for the banks mortgage lending purposes only.If an acceptable Managed Desktop Valuation (MDV) has been completed which is suitable for our lending purposes, even if the property has been valued less than expected, a Physical Valuation (PV) will not be undertaken.We will only complete a subsequent Physical Valuation (PV) if the property has been valued less than expected,andit affects the amount of lending and/or the LTV rates available.The type of valuation required is dependent on certain factors and a drive-by valuation cannot be used to support mortgage borrowing.A Physical Valuation is mandatory for all New Build properties less than two years old.Down valued casesWhere a property is down valued, an appeal can be raised if the figure provided by the valuer is lower than the expected property value by 20% or more, and the LTV, rate or lending amount has been impacted.E.g.

We will consider lending on the following properties:In Wales, those covered by the Welsh Government’s funded remediation schemes.In England, if the property is to be remediated under a suitable remediation scheme or leaseholders are protected under the provisions of the Building Safety Act 2022.New to bank buy to let properties in England and Wales may be considered for lending where there is evidence, they will be fully remediated within 6 months, and it is confirmed that the leaseholder would not be liable for any costs associated with the remediation.*Note – there are currently no remediation schemes for properties of 11m/4 storeys or less.The following information may also be requested:Confirmation of any contribution that the leaseholder is liable for in respect to any proposed programme of remediation works.Confirmation of any start date for remediation works.If providing details of a remediation scheme (as above) then no EWS1 form is required.The bank will be guided by the valuer to confirm the suitability of the property for mortgage purposes.New to bank Buy to Let where remediation will not be complete within 6 months and Second Home applications are not considered suitable for the remediation scheme lending.For properties in Scotland and Northern Ireland where the EWS1 form confirms that the property does not meet minimum safety standards, the property will be deemed unsuitable for mortgage lending and we will be unable to proceed with an application.Where an EWS1 form is required in respect of the building, it should be signed by a person holding a qualification from an organisation included in the EWS-Form List of Relevant Professional Bodies.The documentation must be fully completed and be accompanied by a letter on company headed paper from the signing firm which details their area of business, qualifications and confirms they completed the form.Type of valuationHSBC UK only offer a Standard Valuation or a Scottish Transcript as part of our application process.If you require a more detailed type of valuation report (i.e. Homebuyers or Buildings Survey) you can source this independently using the services of an appropriately qualified surveyor, details of which can be found via theRICS website.ApplicantAgeThe minimum age for Buy to Let and Let to Buy mortgage applicants is 18.ForIncome Cover Ratio (ICR)assessments there is no maximum age.EligibilityMortgage payments to be funded by rental income onlyNo more than three UK BTL mortgaged properties can be held at any one timeWe do not accept applications where we consider the applicant to be aportfolio landlordWe do not accept applications for Commercial Buy to LetApplications from UK residents must have at least one applicant with a minimum basic income of £25,000 per year (excluding rental income).

This takes into account potential future interest rate rises.Please note that when working out whether a basic or high rate taxpayer, total income should be considered.  This should include rental income that is currently being received along with 75% of any proposed new property rental income (if a BTL Purchase application).For higher rate tax payers, we will assess affordability based on the annual rental income, which must be equal to or greater than 145% of the annual Buy to Let mortgage payments, calculated at the stressed rate or product rate, whichever is higher.For joint applicants, both applicants need to be a basic rate tax payer to achieve a stressed rate of 125%, otherwise 145% will be applied if one applicant is a basic rate tax payer and the other applicant a higher rate tax payer.For applications from non-UK residents, we will assess affordability based on the annual rental income, which must be equal to or greater than 145% of the annual Buy to Let mortgage payments, calculated at the stressed rate or product rate, whichever is higher.A further check is also required to ensure that the rental payment is sufficient to cover the mortgage payment on a capital repayment basis.Stressed RateBuy to Let stressed rate is currently:Loan typeUK ResidentsLTV 75% or lessUK ResidentsOver 75% LTVNon-UK ResidentsAll applications on a 5 year fixed rateProduct Rate + 1% or 4.9% (whichever is higher)Product Rate + 1.15% or 5.7% (whichever is higher)Product Rate + 1.05% or 5.35% (whichever is higher)Like for like remortgage on a 2 year fixed rateProduct Rate + 1.1% or 5.05% (whichever is higher)Product Rate + 1.25% or 6.15% (whichever is higher)Product Rate + 1.15% or 5.55% (whichever is higher)All other applications on a 2 year fixed rateProduct Rate + 2% or 5.5% (whichever is higher)Product Rate + 2% or 6.15% (whichever is higher)Product Rate + 2% or 5.55% (whichever is higher)All applications on a Tracker rateProduct Rate + 2% or 5.9% (whichever is higher)N/AProduct Rate + 2% or 6.35% (whichever is higher)Please refer to theBuy to Let calculatorwhich will provide guidance as to whether the rental income is sufficient coverage for a full mortgage application.A Professional Valuation is mandatory for all Buy to Let applications, which will be used to confirm the expected monthly rental income and the demand for rental property in the specified location.Let to buyWe will accept applications to convert a UK residential mortgage, held with another UK lender, to an HSBC UK Buy to Let mortgage via our Let to Buy journey.HSBC UK do not accept Let to Buy mortgages on unencumbered properties.Let to Buy mortgages are available to applicant(s) seeking to remortgage their existing residential property to a Buy to Let mortgage, for the purpose of purchasing another residential property.The current UK residential mortgage must be held with another lender not HSBC UK.Let to Buy affordability criteria is the same as Buy to Let criteria.It is essential that Let to Buy applications are keyed correctly by selecting ‘Let to Buy’ as the ‘Nature of Loan’ on the Broker platform. Any cases keyed incorrectly as Buy to Let, will need to be rekeyed.For all Let to Buy applications there is a requirement to provide evidence of the new Residential mortgage payment. For example, a quotation, a Decision/Agreement in Principle, or a Mortgage Offer document where this amount is shown.If the onward Residential purchase is being submitted with HSBC UK, please add notes on both Let to Buy and Residential applications to advise they are linked. There is no specific order in which these applications need to be keyed/submitted, but we would expect both applications to be completed at a similar time to be able to cross reference.Please ensure that you have correctly included the new Let to Buy mortgage payment in the onward Residential purchase application. Do not duplicate the existing Residential mortgage payment that will cease once the new Let to Buy mortgage is in place.We will not treat the onward residential as aSecond propertywhere the current residential property is being converted to a Let to buy, therefore it is not subject to the 80% LTV cap (standard LTV limits apply).The future rental income from the Let to buy can also be utilised within the onward residential purchase application. Please note this does not apply to unencumbered properties.This can be evidenced from the valuation report if the Let to buy application is with HSBC UK, or a letter from the Association of Rental Letting Agents (ARLA) if the Let to buy application is with another lender.Existing borrowersDeceased CustomersProduct Switch - If a joint mortgage where one of the parties has passed away, you are able to complete a product switch for the remaining customer who is the surviving borrower, while the mortgage is still in joint names. Please ensure that the customer has already notified HSBC UK Mortgage Service Centre of their deceased partner.Additional Borrowing/any other changes - If a joint mortgage where one of the parties has passed away please advise the surviving borrower to contact HSBC UK to discuss any future requirements, while the mortgage is still in joint names.OverpaymentsAccess ourcalculatorsto find out how a regular or lump sum overpayment could reduce the term and interest paid on the mortgage.Lump sum and overpayments can be made at any time to our lifetime tracker mortgages.Our fixed rate and discount mortgages have an annual overpayment allowance equivalent to 10% of the principal mortgage balance at drawdown, or at the start of a new rate switch.Overpayments can be made by lump sum reductions and/or additional ad-hoc payments credited direct to the mortgage.The monthly payments will remain the same unless the customer asks us to recalculate them on their reduced mortgage balance.Alternatively, the customer can set up a flexible overpayment arrangement. If they choose this method, we will collect the overpayment in with the existing direct debit payment. The arrangement can be set up for a specific period or until further notice, your customer will need to make sure the monthly overpayments will not exceed their annual allowance in any one period.When the current rate changes, the customer will need to review the arrangement again as the standard monthly payments and allowance will be reset.At the end of the flexible overpayment arrangement the standard monthly payments will automatically be reset. This is the same if there is a change to the monthly payment date, rate or an amendment to the overpayment arrangement to a different amount. The recalculation will take into account previous overpayments, as it is calculated on the principal mortgage balance, the current interest rate and the remaining mortgage term.If a new flexible overpayment arrangement is put in place, or when the current overpayment arrangement ends, the bank will acknowledge this with a letter to the customers to confirm the new payments being collected.The overpayment allowance is reset annually on the anniversary of the drawdown, or at the start of the new rate following a switch.If your customer switches rates before this anniversary date, a new overpayment will commence from the date the new rate begins and will be calculated by using 10% of the mortgage balance at this time. An overpayment allowance is not transferable to the next overpayment period, therefore any allowance not utilised will be forfeited.The Early Repayment Charge (ERC) will only be applied to the mortgage if the customer was to exceed the overpayment allowance in any one annual period. This applies to an overpayment made by lump sum payments, ad-hoc payments or on a monthly overpayment arrangement.We cannot amend or set up the overpayment arrangement if the mortgage is in the billing cycle, this means 5 working days prior to the monthly mortgage payment being collected. If you wish to cancel this arrangement, you will need to do so at least 7 working days before the payment is due.By making overpayments, the customer will benefit from an interest saving immediately as interest is charged daily. The term of the mortgage may be reduced which can result in the loan being repaid earlier. This will only be achieved if overpayments are continually made throughout the original mortgage term.If monthly payments are reset, they are calculated over the original mortgage term/remaining term.Any projected savings as a result of overpayments are subject to change. The projections are not guaranteed as they are based on the current interest rate, the overpayments against the existing monthly payments, and the remaining term. All of these factors will change.Any changes to the interest rate, payment date, or if the overpayment arrangement stops will result in the standard payments being recalculated over the original term. We will revert to a standard monthly payment (minimum payment) following these changes.If the annual overpayment allowance is set in a leap year, the allowance will not commence on drawdown or amendment, and will instead reset the following working day.Online banking customers can view their overpayment allowance by using the overpayment screen on their mortgage account. This shows the annual allowance amount, the start and end dates for the current period and the allowance balance remaining if overpayments have been paid.Placing an application / Cancelling a caseSubmitting an Additional Borrowing, Porting or Product Switch applicationTo commence an Additional Borrowing, Porting or Product Switch application, select 'Existing customer' from thebroker portalafter logging in.For Additional Borrowing and Product Switch applications you will need to accept the customer offer document on behalf of your client to ensure the application completes.For Porting applications, receipt of the Certificate of Title (COT) auto-triggers the offer acceptance, so you do not have to manually accept it for this type of application.For further information about applications for existing HSBC UK mortgage customers, please take a look at ourFrequently Asked Questions.Cancelling a caseFor all application types you must inform us if you wish to cancel the case.Many of our processes in the application journey are now automated, therefore the case may reach completion if you do not advise us that it should be cancelled.For Product Switch applications only:On the Broker Platform, enter the application reference and use the ‘Cancel application’ option.For all other application types, please call our Broker Support Team on 0345 6005847 (Monday – Friday 9am to 5pm) if you wish to cancel a submitted application.For all Application types where a booking fee has already been paid, this will be refunded within 48 hours.PortingYou can complete a Porting application request on behalf of your customer under the following circumstances:Porting EligibilityYour customer is an existing HSBC UK mortgage customerYour customer is on a Fixed Rate, Term Tracker or Lifetime TrackerThe eligible rate will need to have at least 6 months remainingThe sale and purchase will be completed simultaneouslyIf your customer is looking to port their current product, they will need to be aware of the following exclusions which will result in their application not proceeding:Porting ExclusionsAny account in arrearsMore than six existing loan partsMore than two applicantsPorting a HSBC closed secured loanEquity buy-out (EBO)Marital DisputesWhere there is an existing application in progress (this will include a product switch application)Further InformationFor the total borrowing amount, a procuration fee of 0.4% residential and 0.5% BTL will be paid for the new lending upon completion.You will be able to complete Simultaneous Porting applications, where the existing HSBC mortgage must be repaid simultaneously with the drawdown of the new application.As a Porting application is an onward purchase you can also apply to amend details (subject to meeting eligibility criteria) such as loan term, repayment type, add on an applicant (as long as no more than 2 applicants in total) etc.Product switchingWhen completing a Product Switch application on behalf of your client you will need to accept the customer offer document to ensure the application completes.You can complete a product switch on behalf of your client under the following circumstances:Product Switch EligibilityYour client is an existing HSBC UK mortgage customerYour client is on a Fixed Rate, Term Tracker, Lifetime Tracker or Standard Variable RateIf a joint mortgage where one of the parties has passed away, you are able to complete a product switch for the remaining customer who is the surviving borrower, while the mortgage is still in joint names.

The TA policy cannot be applied to an external remortgage application, where your customer is seeking to transfer an existing mortgage from another lender without increasing their mortgage borrowing.Under no circumstance should an application which meets TA criteria be declined or turned away without being formally assessed by an underwriter. This includes where the Decision in Principle offers less than the customers current mortgage.

If they choose this method, we will collect the overpayment in with the existing direct debit payment. The arrangement can be set up for a specific period or until further notice, your customer will need to make sure the monthly overpayments will not exceed their annual allowance in any one period.When the current rate changes, the customer will need to review the arrangement again as the standard monthly payments and allowance will be reset.At the end of the flexible overpayment arrangement the standard monthly payments will automatically be reset. This is the same if there is a change to the monthly payment date, rate or an amendment to the overpayment arrangement to a different amount. The recalculation will take into account previous overpayments, as it is calculated on the principal mortgage balance, the current interest rate and the remaining mortgage term.If a new flexible overpayment arrangement is put in place, or when the current overpayment arrangement ends, the bank will acknowledge this with a letter to the customers to confirm the new payments being collected.The overpayment allowance is reset annually on the anniversary of the drawdown, or at the start of the new rate following a switch.If your customer switches rates before this anniversary date, a new overpayment will commence from the date the new rate begins and will be calculated by using 10% of the mortgage balance at this time. An overpayment allowance is not transferable to the next overpayment period, therefore any allowance not utilised will be forfeited.The Early Repayment Charge (ERC) will only be applied to the mortgage if the customer was to exceed the overpayment allowance in any one annual period. This applies to an overpayment made by lump sum payments, ad-hoc payments or on a monthly overpayment arrangement.We cannot amend or set up the overpayment arrangement if the mortgage is in the billing cycle, this means 5 working days prior to the monthly mortgage payment being collected. If you wish to cancel this arrangement, you will need to do so at least 7 working days before the payment is due.By making overpayments, the customer will benefit from an interest saving immediately as interest is charged daily. The term of the mortgage may be reduced which can result in the loan being repaid earlier. This will only be achieved if overpayments are continually made throughout the original mortgage term.If monthly payments are reset, they are calculated over the original mortgage term/remaining term.Any projected savings as a result of overpayments are subject to change. The projections are not guaranteed as they are based on the current interest rate, the overpayments against the existing monthly payments, and the remaining term. All of these factors will change.Any changes to the interest rate, payment date, or if the overpayment arrangement stops will result in the standard payments being recalculated over the original term.

Early Repayment Charges do not apply to tracker mortgages.Although Early Repayment Charges apply to our fixed and discount rate mortgages, we provide customers with an annual overpayment allowance equivalent to 10% of the remaining mortgage balance. This means customers can choose to increase their monthly mortgage payments or make lump sum payments up to this allowance each year that Early Repayment Charges apply, without incurring any charges. The overpayment allowance is refreshed annually on the anniversary of the drawdown or the start of the new rate following a switch, and will be based on the current balance at the time. If the customer switches rates before this anniversary date, a new overpayment allowance will commence from the date the new rate begins.If fixed or discount rate customers exceed their annual overpayment allowance for a given year, an Early Repayment Charge will be charged on the amount they have repaid over the allowance.Exit feeHSBC does not currently charge borrowers any exit fee when they fully repay their mortgage.Fee SaverOur Fee Saver deal means no booking fee and no standard valuation fee.A completion fee is payable in all buyer and package types apart from Remortgage my existing mortgage applications via HSBC UK where a fees assisted Legals only product is selected.We will cover the cost of one standard valuation where this is required by HSBC UK as part of the mortgage application.Other fees and charges may be payable to other parties including, but not limited to legal fees and charges levied by an existing lender.Legal feesThese are the fees payable to the applicant's solicitor or licensed conveyancer acting on behalf of the applicant and/or HSBC.

For further information regarding lending to repay bridging loans please refer to ourdebt consolidation criteria.Concessionary purchaseWe can lend up to the maximum allowable LTV of the lower of the discounted purchase price or valuation.  This ensures that customers are contributing to the purchase, rather than relying on any equity in the property to fund the deposit.Daily interestThe interest chargeable on the mortgage balance will be calculated every day rather than at the end of each week, month or year.Debt consolidationA further advance for debt consolidation purposes is possible subject to customers meeting the following requirements:maximum of £50,000 anda maximum LTV of 80%, or 60% if there is any element of interest only borrowing.Please notethat all debt commitments will still be included in the affordability assessment, unless it can be proven that the commitment finishes in the next 6 months.The following provides examples of common scenarios and gives guidance on whether they would be categorised by HSBC as debt consolidation (please note that this is not an exhaustive list):Debt ConsolidationNon Debt ConsolidationMonies borrowed from family and friendsfor the sole purpose of purchasing the property or to protect/improve our security and where there is anagreementin place for the repayment of the funds.Please note:If the debt consolidation request exceeds £50,000 and your client is an existing HSBC customer, please discuss with your BDM before submission.Monies borrowed from family and friendsfor the sole purpose of purchasing the property or to protect/improve our security and where the funds were originally agiftbut the customer now chooses to repay them.Repayment of funds obtained from the customer's business:Where the funds were obtained through a Directors loan or other agreement detailing terms of repayment and were for the sole purpose of purchasing the property or to protect/improve our security.Repayment of funds obtained from the customer's business through their share of the net profit:Where the funds obtained were for the sole purpose of purchasing the property or to protect/improve our security and the customer wants to replenish the funds. These will be treated as a business investment and the HOL policy for business lending will need to be followed.Repayment of a second charge loan against the security propertyRepayment of a second /subsequent charge is only possible when the additional borrowing is linked to a remortgage. It is not available as a standalone Additional Borrowing application.Transfer of security:Customer has first charge residential or Buy to Let mortgage lending secured against a property which was for the purpose of purchasing that property and wishes to transfer the lending to another property they own.Repayment of contractual debt:Where a customer has a debt for which there is a contract in place stipulating the terms and conditions such as length of contract, terms of repayment etc. (For example credit card, personal loan, bridging loans, hire purchase agreement, PCP car agreement including repayment of the final or balloon payment).Repayment of shared equity:Where a customer has taken a mortgage with another lender along with a Government Help to Buy Loan or other shared equity provider and now wishes to remortgage to HSBC with additional lending to fully repay the shared equity charge. These will be processed in line with our policy on purchase of a final share of a shared ownership property.Repayment of savings:Where a customer has used their savings to purchase a property or for home improvements due to the timescales involved with the mortgage process and wishes to use secured lending to replenish their savings.DepositYou need to confirm and document the source of an applicant's deposit as we will be unable to complete the mortgage without this information.Please do not forward any form of documentary evidence regarding deposits unless specifically requested.Foreign NationalsDeposit is funded from customer’s own resources, i.e. personal savings. Gifts are not acceptable unless they are in addition to the 15 per cent deposit provided from the applicants own resources.Non-UK ResidentsDeposit is funded from customer’s own resources, i.e. personal savings. Gifts are not acceptable unless they are in addition to the 25 per cent deposit provided from the applicants own resources.Family discounted purchaseWhere the property is a discounted purchase from a family member, we will only lend up to the maximum allowable LTV of the lower of the ‘discounted’ purchase price or valuation. We will also rely on the solicitor or licensed conveyancer to satisfy themselves that the family member gifting the property is not insolvent, and to arrange suitable indemnity insurance for the full value of the property if they deem it necessary.Armed Forces concessionCustomers who are wanting to use Armed Forces Help to Buy Loan as a deposit for their mortgage will need to contact HSBC UK directly to complete these applications.Acceptable sources of depositPersonal savingsFunded from the customer's own resources.Secured borrowingFunds raised by releasing equity from another property owned by the applicant, this includes secure bridging loansGifted deposit from family member (including where protected by a Declaration of Trust)Where the deposit has been 'gifted' by a family member, the acting solicitor/conveyancer must obtain a signed letter from the donor to confirm the deposit is a 'non-refundable and an unconditional gift and that no interest is claimed in the property'.Please note – a family member is considered to be close relation defined as a spouse, domestic partner, grandparent, parent, sibling, half sibling, aunt, uncle, cousin, in law relation or step relation.If a family member is contributing towards the purchase price and wishes to protect their beneficial interest by way of a Declaration of Trust, we will need to approve this and ensure our interest in the property is protected. We will also require a Letter of Consent to be signed by the contributor.Please note: We are unable to proceed if a Declaration of Trust is to be created against a property that will be registered to a sole proprietor (property owner)Gifted deposit from occupier not named on mortgageWhere the deposit has been 'gifted' by an occupier not named on the mortgage, the acting solicitor/conveyancer must obtain a signed letter from the donor to confirm the deposit is a 'non-refundable and an unconditional gift and that no interest is claimed in the property'.We cannot accept the gifted deposit if the occupier is not a family member.Developer gifted deposit/IncentiveFinancial incentives provided by a Developer up to 5% of the property price are acceptable without impacting the property value. Where the value of a financial incentive is above 5%, the difference must be deducted from the purchase price. We can only lend up to the maximum allowable LTV of the discounted purchase price or valuation.Not acceptable sources of depositUnsecured credit facilities or personal borrowingMoney that is borrowed by the customer other than by way of a legal mortgage over property owned by them and will need to be repaid at any point in the future must not represent any element of the deposit.ConcessionaryWe can only lend up to the maximum allowable LTV of the lower of the ‘discounted’ purchase price or valuation. This will ensure that the customer(s) are contributing a deposit to the purchase rather than relying on any equity within the property to fund this.Gifted deposit not from immediate familyA deposit that is gifted that does not fall in the above acceptable categories of gifted deposit from family member or gifted deposit from occupier not named on mortgage.Vendor gifted depositAny incentives provided by the vendor should be discounted from the purchase price.

Please refer to theproduct finderfor our current range..To check an EPC rating, please refer to the Government website:find an energy certificate..A PEA rated property will be a new build property, PEA certificates are provided by the Developer..If the PEA certificate has limited address information please also provide the Plot Reservation form for the property (also provided by the Developer).Independent Legal AdviceIndependent Legal Advice (ILA) is the process where a person is advised by their own solicitor or licensed conveyancer, in a face to face meeting in the absence of the borrower and other interested parties, as to the consequences for them of executing a mortgage deed and agreeing to secure new borrowing on a property they own or will own.HSBC's policy is that the owner(s) of a property must be advised of the legal consequences of providing a mortgage over it to secure residential lending. This will help ensure that the bank's security is enforceable against the borrower(s) and the owner(s) of the property, that customers are treated fairly and that the bank is lending responsibly.As a result, HSBC requires ILA in the following scenarios:There is a difference of more than £50,000 between one or more individual owners the owner benefiting least will require ILAThe funds are being gifted to a third party) and the difference in benefit to the third party compared to owners is more than £50,000. In this instance ILA is required for all owners/borrowers.Exception – ILA is not required where the difference in benefit is less than £50,000, regardless of funds being used for individual owners or gifted to a third party. It is also not required where funds are for school fees for a dependent child under the age of 18.The funds are being injected into a business that is not 100% owned by the property owner/s and the difference in benefit to the business compared to the property owners is more than £50,000.Where the business is 100% owned by the property owner/s, ILA is recommended.ILA CostsThe customer is responsible for all ILA-related fees, and should consult their chosen ILA firm for the exact cost. Where ILA is mandatory and the application is going through the LMS panel, there is an additional fee payable to the LMS panel firm for the additional work associated with this.Guidance on who provides the ILAIf an LMS panel is acting for HSBC as part of the transaction, the customer must instruct a different firm to provide the ILA. LMS act for HSBC in the following applications and so a conflict of interest would result if the firm were also to provide the ILA:RemortgageUnencumbered HOLShared Ownership *Transfer of Title*We currently do not provide this specific type of mortgage through HSBC intermediary channel.The person receiving ILA can use a solicitor or licenced conveyancer who they know to provide this service or they can find one by visiting:England and Wales:http://solicitors.lawsociety.org.uk/?Pro=Truehttps://www.clc-uk.org/find-a-clc-lawyer/Scotland:http://www.lawscot.org.uk/Northern Ireland:http://www.lawsoc-ni.orgInterest onlySingle applicants requesting a residential interest-only mortgage will be required to have an annual minimum income £75,000 which must meet our income eligibility criteria below.

Additional repayment vehicles can be used for lending above this LTV)SavingsEndowmentsStocks and Shares ISAInvestmentsSale of Other PropertyIf the intended repayment plan is not a fully funded, our affordability assessment will be based on a Capital Repayment basis.For more details, please seeInterest Only Repayment Plans.We are unable to accept the following as a suitable repayment plan:Sale of current or planned main residence at the end of the termSale of commercial or overseas propertyLump sum from a personal or occupational pension scheme – because of frequent changes to pension policies and regulations which make assessment of credibility difficult.Interest Only loans are restricted to Interest Only LTV limits. However, any additional lending can be added on a Capital Repayment basis with the additional lending restricted to Capital Repayment LTV limits. Please refer toLoansection for further details.LoanThe minimum amount we can lend is £10,000.

Under this scenario, two fees may be payable if a different rate is chosen for each loan part.PropertyAnnexe / Granny flatIn order to be considered suitable security, properties with an annexe/annexes must meet the following requirements:The size of the annexe must be proportionate in size and smaller than the main dwelling.If the annex is on a separate legal title, it will not be included in the valuation.The saleability of the main property should not be adversely affected by the presence of the annexe.Vacant possession is required purchase cases.The following criteria will NOT be acceptable:Non-residential uses for the annexe (e.g. Airbnb, guest house, commercial live/work, office or shop).If there is any evidence that the access rights to the main property run through the land in the annex title, unless a charge was also taken over the annex title.The bank will be guided by the type of valuation received and any additional guidance from the valuer (in cases where a PV has been completed).Commercial property close byWe can lend against residential properties with commercial properties close by, subject to the valuer's comments that the property is suitable security.Discounted propertiesWe can only lend up to the maximum allowable LTV of the lower of the 'discounted' purchase price or valuation. This will ensure that customers are contributing a deposit to the purchase, rather than relying on any equity in the property to fund this.Family-discounted purchaseWhere the property is a discounted purchase from a family member, we will only lend up to the maximum allowable LTV of the lower of the 'discounted' purchase price or valuation. We will also require the solicitor or licensed conveyancer to satisfy themselves that the family member gifting the property is not insolvent and to arrange suitable indemnity insurance for the full value of the property if they deem it necessary.Please note, when an applicant is purchasing a property from a family member separate legal representation is required. It is HSBC policy that the same solicitor or licensed conveyancer cannot act for both seller and buyer.FlatsThe maximum LTV borrowing on a flat is 90%. For new build flats this reduces to 85%. Ex-local authority flats have a maximum LTV of 80%.If you intend to capitalise a booking fee then the loan amount plus the added fee must remain within the LTV restrictions stated above.The above maximum LTV also only applies where the total loan size is not exceeded.Please refer to theLoansection for further information on LTV limits.In order to be considered suitable for mortgage purposes, flats must be habitable with a fully functioning internal kitchen and bathroom and with no restrictions on occupancy.Investor led properties (i.e. where the majority of the units within a building are not owner occupied) are not accepted.Buildings insurance covering the full cost of re-building the flat must be in place for the duration of the term of the mortgage.We will not normally lend where:The block is above four storeys high and there is no lift;Where the lease of the flat / maisonette does not contain adequate covenants and arrangements in respect of the common services in line with our instructions to the Conveyancer. This will form part of the conveyancing checks orThe property is in an ex-local authority high rise block with seven or more floors.Please note, while blocks of flats with more than 4 floors including the ground floor with no lift are normally considered unacceptable for mortgage purposes, some exceptions can be made. Good quality, private sector purpose build or converted blocks of flats in prestigious areas of central London or in prime city centres (where the benefits of city living outweigh the unusual market resistance to high rise blocks, exhibiting strong saleability, in excellent condition and with sustainable re-sale potential) may be considered on individual merit by the valuer.In all cases, we will require the valuer to confirm that the flat is both mortgageable and marketable.Where the valuer identifies evidence of cladding on a property, additional checks and an EWS1 (External Wall Fire Review) form may be required to determine whether the cladding material meets minimum safety standards or is defective.An EWS1 form will be required in the following circumstances:For buildings over six storeys:There is cladding or curtain wall glazing on the building orthere are balconies which stack vertically above each other and either both the balustrades and decking are constructed with combustible materials (e.g. timber) or the decking is constructed with combustible materials and the balconies are directly linked by combustible material.For buildings of five or six storeysThere is a significant amount of cladding on the building (for the purpose of this guidance, approximately one quarter of the whole elevation estimated from what is visible standing at ground level is a significant amount) orthere are ACM, MCM or HPL panels on the building* orthere are balconies which stack vertically above each other and either both the balustrades and decking are constructed with combustible materials (e.g. timber), or the decking is constructed with combustible materials and the balconies are directly linked by combustible materials orthere is cladding around the main route of escape or linking multiple floors of a building with potential to promote the spread of fire, even if less than one quarter of whole elevation.For buildings of four storeys or fewer:There are ACM, MCM or HPL panels on the building** Note: metal cladding and ACM/MCM are visually very similar, so if metal panel cladding is present an EWS1 inspection should be requested unless the valuer is satisfied that the cladding isnotACM/MCM and can fully justify their decision.Where properties have failed their EWS1/FRAEW assessment. We will consider lending on the following properties:In Wales, those covered by the Welsh Government’s funded remediation schemes.In England, if the property is to be remediated under a suitable remediation scheme or leaseholders are protected under the provisions of the Building Safety Act 2022.New to bank buy to let properties in England and Wales may be considered for lending where there is evidence, they will be fully remediated within 6 months, and it is confirmed that the leaseholder would not be liable for any costs associated with the remediation.*Note – there are currently no remediation schemes for properties of 11m/4 storeys or less.The following information may also be requested:Confirmation of any contribution that the leaseholder is liable for in respect to any proposed programme of remediation works.Confirmation of any start date for remediation works.If providing details of a remediation scheme (as above) then no EWS1 form is required.The bank will be guided by the valuer to confirm the suitability of the property for mortgage purposes.New to bank Buy to Let where remediation will not be complete within 6 months and Second Home applications are not considered suitable for the remediation scheme lending.For properties in Scotland and Northern Ireland where the EWS1 form confirms that the property does not meet minimum safety standards, the property will be deemed unsuitable for mortgage lending and we will be unable to proceed with an application.Where an EWS1 form is required in respect of the building, it should be signed by a person holding a qualification from an organisation included in the EWS-Form List of Relevant Professional Bodies.The documentation must be fully completed and be accompanied by a letter on company headed paper from the signing firm which details their area of business, qualifications and confirms they completed the form.Studio flatsThere are no restrictions on studio flats. We can lend, subject to valuer's comments that the property is suitable security.Japanese knotweedJapanese Knotweed is an invasive plant that grows rapidly and can cause structural damage to buildings and roads.Where Japanese Knotweed has not been identified within the boundaries of the property, but is present on neighbouring land within three metres of the boundary, the valuer will report this to the bank but no remediating action should be required.Where Japanese Knotweed has been identified within the boundaries of the property being mortgaged to the Bank, we can proceed where there is no visible damage to outbuildings, paths and fences. We will rely on the valuer to assess the damage or any restrictions to access which may be caused by the presence of Japanese Knotweed and to confirm whether a specialist report is required.  If so, we will require the following:A treatment plan which has been fully completed by an appropriately qualified person or company such as an accredited member of an industry recognised trade association such as the Property Care Association and the Invasive Non-Native Specialists AssociationA Completion Certificate that confirms the weed has already been fully remediated with a minimum 10 year insurance backed guarantee in placeA copy of the Completion Certificate and Guarantee are to be provided to the valuer for their confirmation that the property is suitable for mortgage security and whether there is any impact on the valuation of the propertyNote: Where the valuer confirms there is no visible damage and the property is acceptable for mortgage purposes, the presence of Japanese Knotweed could still impact the value.LocationHSBC can provide mortgages in mainland England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Scottish Isles.New buildWe define a new build property as one that will be occupied for the first time and/or has been built and completed within the last 24 months.Although we can approve mortgages on properties not yet built subject to satisfactory valuation, we will not release funds until the property has been completed. A re-inspection may be required if the surveyor advises one is necessary in their original valuation.Standard lending criteria apply subject to:A maximum 90% LTV for houses. The maximum LTV only applies where the total loan size is not exceeded as set out in theLoansection.A maximum of 85% LTV for flats The maximum LTV only applies where the total loan size is not exceeded as set out in theLoansection.If you intend to capitalise a booking fee then the loan amount plus the added fee must remain within the LTV restrictions stated above.A structural defects warranty being in place.New Build IncentivesFinancial IncentivesFinancial incentives up to 5% of the property price are acceptable without impacting property value.Where the value of a financial incentive isabove 5%, the difference must still be deducted from the purchase price for LTV purposes.Non-Financial IncentivesAny non-financial incentives offered by a builder / developer are acceptable without impacting LTV.Any incentives either financial or non-financial must still be declared.New home warranty schemes -  Structural defects warranty / insuranceIt is a requirement that where a property has been built or converted within the last 10 years (purchase application) or two years (remortgage /unencumbered additional borrowing application), it has the benefit of a suitable new home warranty (Structural defects warranty / SDW) or Professional Consultants Certificate in place from the practical completion of the property.AcceptableNew home warranty schemes:ABC+ WarrantyAdvantage HCIArk Insurance Group LtdBuild Assure New Homes/Build Assure 10Building Life Plans (BLP)Build-Zone New Home WarrantyCheckmate Castle 10 Home WarrantyGlobal Home Warranties LtdHomeproof – formerly known as Aedis Warranties LtdInternational Construction Warranties Ltd (ICW)Local Authority Building Control (LABC) New Home WarrantyNHBCOne GuaranteePremier GuaranteeProtekThe Q PolicyProfessional Consultants Certificate (PCC)A PCC is only acceptable for newly built homes within a development of no more than 10 properties.If the property is a flat or maisonette, a PCC must be available for the common parts and the structure of the building if these are part of the new build/conversion works.The professional consultant should have one or more of the following qualifications:fellow or member of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (FRICS or MRICS); orfellow or member of the Institution of Structural Engineers (F.I.Struct.E or M.I.Struct.E); orfellow or member of the Chartered Institute of Building (FCIOB or MCIOB); orfellow or member of the Architecture and Surveying Institute (FASI or MASI) (only if in conjunction with a FCIOB or MCIOB qualification); orfellow or member of the Chartered Association of Building Engineers (C.Build E MCABE or C.Build E FCABE); ormember of the Chartered Institute of Architectural Technologists (MCIAT); orarchitect registered with the Architects Registration Board (ARB).

This is because the warranty provider will not have carried out any inspections during construction, so they offer no assurance that the property was suitably constructedRetrospective PCC’s from a professional who has not supervised the project from the start and inspected the build at regular intervals are not acceptableThe latent defects policy obtainable through HBUK insurers is not a suitable policy to cover the lack of the above warranties for residential mortgage purposesNon-standard construction typesProperties constructed using non-standard or non-traditional methods maybe unacceptable for mortgage purposes or lending maybe restricted.The list below is not exhaustive. HSBC will rely on the valuer’s comments.Timber-framedTimber-framed properties constructed between 1920 and 1965 are considered unacceptable for mortgage purposes due to inferior building regulations in relation to vapour barriers.Scottwood/Swedish are also considered unacceptable for mortgage purposes.All timberDue to the unusual nature of the construction, properties made entirely from timber are usually considered restricted. We will be guided by the valuer's comments on marketability. If acceptable, they will be subject to a maximum LTV of 80%Wimpey No Fines and Laing EasiformProperties dated from 1945 onwards are acceptable, subject to the valuer's comments, at the lower LTV ratio of 80%.Bear in mind that Wimpey No-Fines properties are currently being monitored in the north of England where some deterioration has been noted. If this construction type is subsequently defined as 'defective', this could have a significant impact on the value and saleability of the property.Steel frameWater penetration and condensation can cause corrosion of the steel frame causing instability of the property. These properties are acceptable subject to a satisfactory structural engineer's report, at the lower LTV ratio of 80%.Livett Cartwright steel frames, Hawthorn Leslie steel frames with boarded finish, and BISF (British Iron and Steel Federation) are considered unacceptable for mortgage purposes.Kit-builtThe following 'kit-built' type of constructions with special architectural merit or proven long-term durability are considered restricted with a maximum LTV of 80%, subject to usual warranty provision if less than 10 years old:Huf HausPottonSkandia-HusBorder Oak (and other bulk timber kit forms)Colt/Guildway (these types are subject to an entirely satisfactory valuer statement of condition and saleability, which could be enhanced by location if they are found on larger rural or semi-rural plots)DurisolDurisol houses are accepted up to 80% LTV, subject to a satisfactory structural engineer's report. Durisol flats are considered unacceptable for mortgage purposes.Mundic blockProperties containing mundic block materials (primarily situated in Cornwall & Devon) must be tested using the screening test developed by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.

Applications cannot be submitted prior to the bid being accepted.Solicitors will need to complete the legal formalities before the purchase is finalised.Customers must understand that a mortgage offer will not be generated by the bank until a satisfactory valuation has been completed and it has been credit underwritten.Buildings insurance must be in place at time of exchange of contracts.Restrictive covenantsWe cannot provide lending for properties with covenants that restrict the period of occupation and/or the age or type of employment of the occupant.Second kitchensExceptionally, we can lend against properties with 2 kitchens, subject to the valuer's comments that the property is suitable security.Second propertyWe can provide mortgages for second homes if both loans can be serviced entirely from the applicant's salary, subject to our normal credit assessment.

This must not be relied upon to identify any structural defects present in the property.If your customer wishes to be satisfied regarding the structural condition of the proposed property, they must arrange an appropriate survey. Please see the sectionType of Valuationfor more detail.All valuations and mortgage offers are valid for six months. Applications not completed within this time frame will be cancelled.The minimum acceptable property valuation amount is £50,000.An Automated Valuation (AVM), Digital Valuation (DV), Managed Desktop Valuation (MDV) or Physical Valuation (PV) must be used to determine whether a property is suitable security for a mortgage loan.Please note that a valuation is carried out for the banks mortgage lending purposes only.If an acceptable Managed Desktop Valuation (MDV) has been completed which is suitable for our lending purposes, even if the property has been valued less than expected, a Physical Valuation (PV) will not be undertaken.We will only complete a subsequent Physical Valuation (PV) if the property has been valued less than expected,andit affects the amount of lending and/or the LTV rates available.The type of valuation required is dependent on certain factors and a drive-by valuation cannot be used to support mortgage borrowing.A Physical Valuation is mandatory for all New Build properties less than two years old.Down valued casesWhere a property is down valued, an appeal can be raised if the figure provided by the valuer is lower than the expected property value by 20% or more, and the LTV, rate or lending amount has been impacted.E.g.

We will consider lending on the following properties:In Wales, those covered by the Welsh Government’s funded remediation schemes.In England, if the property is to be remediated under a suitable remediation scheme or leaseholders are protected under the provisions of the Building Safety Act 2022.New to bank buy to let properties in England and Wales may be considered for lending where there is evidence, they will be fully remediated within 6 months, and it is confirmed that the leaseholder would not be liable for any costs associated with the remediation.*Note – there are currently no remediation schemes for properties of 11m/4 storeys or less.The following information may also be requested:Confirmation of any contribution that the leaseholder is liable for in respect to any proposed programme of remediation works.Confirmation of any start date for remediation works.If providing details of a remediation scheme (as above) then no EWS1 form is required.The bank will be guided by the valuer to confirm the suitability of the property for mortgage purposes.New to bank Buy to Let where remediation will not be complete within 6 months and Second Home applications are not considered suitable for the remediation scheme lending.For properties in Scotland and Northern Ireland where the EWS1 form confirms that the property does not meet minimum safety standards, the property will be deemed unsuitable for mortgage lending and we will be unable to proceed with an application.Where an EWS1 form is required in respect of the building, it should be signed by a person holding a qualification from an organisation included in the EWS-Form List of Relevant Professional Bodies.The documentation must be fully completed and be accompanied by a letter on company headed paper from the signing firm which details their area of business, qualifications and confirms they completed the form.Type of valuationHSBC UK only offer a Standard Valuation or a Scottish Transcript as part of our application process.If you require a more detailed type of valuation report (i.e. Homebuyers or Buildings Survey) you can source this independently using the services of an appropriately qualified surveyor, details of which can be found via theRICS website.

112. #### Type of buy to let property
============================================================

We define a Consumer Buy to Let as:A property that wasn’t / isn't being initially purchased for a specific purpose of renting (e.g previous home / inherited property / accidental landlord)We define an Investment Buy to Let as:A property that is being purchased / was originally purchased for the specific purposes of renting.


113. ### We define a Consumer Buy to Let as:
============================================================

A property that wasn’t / isn't being initially purchased for a specific purpose of renting (e.g previous home / inherited property / accidental landlord)


114. ### Affordability for HSBC BTL mortgagescan only be assessed using rental income.
============================================================

In addition to rental income coverage, we will assess personal income when making a lending decision.

Consideration will be given to your customer’s personal commitments so to ensure that the lending remains sustainable in the event of tenancy voids, or where maintenance/repair costs have been incurred.

The application may be declined if we determine that there is insufficient disposable income to support the borrowing, or if the overall exposure is too high.


115. ### Income Cover Ratio (ICR) assessment
============================================================

For basic rate tax payers, we will assess affordability based on the annual rental income, which must be equal to or greater than 125% of the annual Buy to Let mortgage payments, calculated at the stressed rate or product rate, whichever is higher. This takes into account potential future interest rate rises.

Please note that when working out whether a basic or high rate taxpayer, total income should be considered.  This should include rental income that is currently being received along with 75% of any proposed new property rental income (if a BTL Purchase application).

For higher rate tax payers, we will assess affordability based on the annual rental income, which must be equal to or greater than 145% of the annual Buy to Let mortgage payments, calculated at the stressed rate or product rate, whichever is higher.

For joint applicants, both applicants need to be a basic rate tax payer to achieve a stressed rate of 125%, otherwise 145% will be applied if one applicant is a basic rate tax payer and the other applicant a higher rate tax payer.

For applications from non-UK residents, we will assess affordability based on the annual rental income, which must be equal to or greater than 145% of the annual Buy to Let mortgage payments, calculated at the stressed rate or product rate, whichever is higher.

A further check is also required to ensure that the rental payment is sufficient to cover the mortgage payment on a capital repayment basis.

Deceased CustomersProduct Switch - If a joint mortgage where one of the parties has passed away, you are able to complete a product switch for the remaining customer who is the surviving borrower, while the mortgage is still in joint names. Please ensure that the customer has already notified HSBC UK Mortgage Service Centre of their deceased partner.Additional Borrowing/any other changes - If a joint mortgage where one of the parties has passed away please advise the surviving borrower to contact HSBC UK to discuss any future requirements, while the mortgage is still in joint names.OverpaymentsAccess ourcalculatorsto find out how a regular or lump sum overpayment could reduce the term and interest paid on the mortgage.Lump sum and overpayments can be made at any time to our lifetime tracker mortgages.Our fixed rate and discount mortgages have an annual overpayment allowance equivalent to 10% of the principal mortgage balance at drawdown, or at the start of a new rate switch.Overpayments can be made by lump sum reductions and/or additional ad-hoc payments credited direct to the mortgage.The monthly payments will remain the same unless the customer asks us to recalculate them on their reduced mortgage balance.Alternatively, the customer can set up a flexible overpayment arrangement. If they choose this method, we will collect the overpayment in with the existing direct debit payment. The arrangement can be set up for a specific period or until further notice, your customer will need to make sure the monthly overpayments will not exceed their annual allowance in any one period.When the current rate changes, the customer will need to review the arrangement again as the standard monthly payments and allowance will be reset.At the end of the flexible overpayment arrangement the standard monthly payments will automatically be reset. This is the same if there is a change to the monthly payment date, rate or an amendment to the overpayment arrangement to a different amount. The recalculation will take into account previous overpayments, as it is calculated on the principal mortgage balance, the current interest rate and the remaining mortgage term.If a new flexible overpayment arrangement is put in place, or when the current overpayment arrangement ends, the bank will acknowledge this with a letter to the customers to confirm the new payments being collected.The overpayment allowance is reset annually on the anniversary of the drawdown, or at the start of the new rate following a switch.If your customer switches rates before this anniversary date, a new overpayment will commence from the date the new rate begins and will be calculated by using 10% of the mortgage balance at this time. An overpayment allowance is not transferable to the next overpayment period, therefore any allowance not utilised will be forfeited.The Early Repayment Charge (ERC) will only be applied to the mortgage if the customer was to exceed the overpayment allowance in any one annual period. This applies to an overpayment made by lump sum payments, ad-hoc payments or on a monthly overpayment arrangement.We cannot amend or set up the overpayment arrangement if the mortgage is in the billing cycle, this means 5 working days prior to the monthly mortgage payment being collected. If you wish to cancel this arrangement, you will need to do so at least 7 working days before the payment is due.By making overpayments, the customer will benefit from an interest saving immediately as interest is charged daily. The term of the mortgage may be reduced which can result in the loan being repaid earlier. This will only be achieved if overpayments are continually made throughout the original mortgage term.If monthly payments are reset, they are calculated over the original mortgage term/remaining term.Any projected savings as a result of overpayments are subject to change. The projections are not guaranteed as they are based on the current interest rate, the overpayments against the existing monthly payments, and the remaining term. All of these factors will change.Any changes to the interest rate, payment date, or if the overpayment arrangement stops will result in the standard payments being recalculated over the original term. We will revert to a standard monthly payment (minimum payment) following these changes.If the annual overpayment allowance is set in a leap year, the allowance will not commence on drawdown or amendment, and will instead reset the following working day.Online banking customers can view their overpayment allowance by using the overpayment screen on their mortgage account. This shows the annual allowance amount, the start and end dates for the current period and the allowance balance remaining if overpayments have been paid.Placing an application / Cancelling a caseSubmitting an Additional Borrowing, Porting or Product Switch applicationTo commence an Additional Borrowing, Porting or Product Switch application, select 'Existing customer' from thebroker portalafter logging in.For Additional Borrowing and Product Switch applications you will need to accept the customer offer document on behalf of your client to ensure the application completes.For Porting applications, receipt of the Certificate of Title (COT) auto-triggers the offer acceptance, so you do not have to manually accept it for this type of application.For further information about applications for existing HSBC UK mortgage customers, please take a look at ourFrequently Asked Questions.Cancelling a caseFor all application types you must inform us if you wish to cancel the case.Many of our processes in the application journey are now automated, therefore the case may reach completion if you do not advise us that it should be cancelled.For Product Switch applications only:On the Broker Platform, enter the application reference and use the ‘Cancel application’ option.For all other application types, please call our Broker Support Team on 0345 6005847 (Monday – Friday 9am to 5pm) if you wish to cancel a submitted application.For all Application types where a booking fee has already been paid, this will be refunded within 48 hours.PortingYou can complete a Porting application request on behalf of your customer under the following circumstances:Porting EligibilityYour customer is an existing HSBC UK mortgage customerYour customer is on a Fixed Rate, Term Tracker or Lifetime TrackerThe eligible rate will need to have at least 6 months remainingThe sale and purchase will be completed simultaneouslyIf your customer is looking to port their current product, they will need to be aware of the following exclusions which will result in their application not proceeding:Porting ExclusionsAny account in arrearsMore than six existing loan partsMore than two applicantsPorting a HSBC closed secured loanEquity buy-out (EBO)Marital DisputesWhere there is an existing application in progress (this will include a product switch application)Further InformationFor the total borrowing amount, a procuration fee of 0.4% residential and 0.5% BTL will be paid for the new lending upon completion.You will be able to complete Simultaneous Porting applications, where the existing HSBC mortgage must be repaid simultaneously with the drawdown of the new application.As a Porting application is an onward purchase you can also apply to amend details (subject to meeting eligibility criteria) such as loan term, repayment type, add on an applicant (as long as no more than 2 applicants in total) etc.Product switchingWhen completing a Product Switch application on behalf of your client you will need to accept the customer offer document to ensure the application completes.You can complete a product switch on behalf of your client under the following circumstances:Product Switch EligibilityYour client is an existing HSBC UK mortgage customerYour client is on a Fixed Rate, Term Tracker, Lifetime Tracker or Standard Variable RateIf a joint mortgage where one of the parties has passed away, you are able to complete a product switch for the remaining customer who is the surviving borrower, while the mortgage is still in joint names.

134. ### We define a Consumer Buy to Let as:
============================================================

A property that wasn’t / isn't being initially purchased for a specific purpose of renting (e.g previous home / inherited property / accidental landlord)


135. ### Affordability for HSBC BTL mortgagescan only be assessed using rental income.
============================================================

In addition to rental income coverage, we will assess personal income when making a lending decision.

Consideration will be given to your customer’s personal commitments so to ensure that the lending remains sustainable in the event of tenancy voids, or where maintenance/repair costs have been incurred.

The application may be declined if we determine that there is insufficient disposable income to support the borrowing, or if the overall exposure is too high.


136. ### Income Cover Ratio (ICR) assessment
============================================================

For basic rate tax payers, we will assess affordability based on the annual rental income, which must be equal to or greater than 125% of the annual Buy to Let mortgage payments, calculated at the stressed rate or product rate, whichever is higher. This takes into account potential future interest rate rises.

Please note that when working out whether a basic or high rate taxpayer, total income should be considered.  This should include rental income that is currently being received along with 75% of any proposed new property rental income (if a BTL Purchase application).

For higher rate tax payers, we will assess affordability based on the annual rental income, which must be equal to or greater than 145% of the annual Buy to Let mortgage payments, calculated at the stressed rate or product rate, whichever is higher.

For joint applicants, both applicants need to be a basic rate tax payer to achieve a stressed rate of 125%, otherwise 145% will be applied if one applicant is a basic rate tax payer and the other applicant a higher rate tax payer.

For applications from non-UK residents, we will assess affordability based on the annual rental income, which must be equal to or greater than 145% of the annual Buy to Let mortgage payments, calculated at the stressed rate or product rate, whichever is higher.

A further check is also required to ensure that the rental payment is sufficient to cover the mortgage payment on a capital repayment basis.

Deceased CustomersProduct Switch - If a joint mortgage where one of the parties has passed away, you are able to complete a product switch for the remaining customer who is the surviving borrower, while the mortgage is still in joint names. Please ensure that the customer has already notified HSBC UK Mortgage Service Centre of their deceased partner.Additional Borrowing/any other changes - If a joint mortgage where one of the parties has passed away please advise the surviving borrower to contact HSBC UK to discuss any future requirements, while the mortgage is still in joint names.OverpaymentsAccess ourcalculatorsto find out how a regular or lump sum overpayment could reduce the term and interest paid on the mortgage.Lump sum and overpayments can be made at any time to our lifetime tracker mortgages.Our fixed rate and discount mortgages have an annual overpayment allowance equivalent to 10% of the principal mortgage balance at drawdown, or at the start of a new rate switch.Overpayments can be made by lump sum reductions and/or additional ad-hoc payments credited direct to the mortgage.The monthly payments will remain the same unless the customer asks us to recalculate them on their reduced mortgage balance.Alternatively, the customer can set up a flexible overpayment arrangement. If they choose this method, we will collect the overpayment in with the existing direct debit payment. The arrangement can be set up for a specific period or until further notice, your customer will need to make sure the monthly overpayments will not exceed their annual allowance in any one period.When the current rate changes, the customer will need to review the arrangement again as the standard monthly payments and allowance will be reset.At the end of the flexible overpayment arrangement the standard monthly payments will automatically be reset. This is the same if there is a change to the monthly payment date, rate or an amendment to the overpayment arrangement to a different amount. The recalculation will take into account previous overpayments, as it is calculated on the principal mortgage balance, the current interest rate and the remaining mortgage term.If a new flexible overpayment arrangement is put in place, or when the current overpayment arrangement ends, the bank will acknowledge this with a letter to the customers to confirm the new payments being collected.The overpayment allowance is reset annually on the anniversary of the drawdown, or at the start of the new rate following a switch.If your customer switches rates before this anniversary date, a new overpayment will commence from the date the new rate begins and will be calculated by using 10% of the mortgage balance at this time. An overpayment allowance is not transferable to the next overpayment period, therefore any allowance not utilised will be forfeited.The Early Repayment Charge (ERC) will only be applied to the mortgage if the customer was to exceed the overpayment allowance in any one annual period. This applies to an overpayment made by lump sum payments, ad-hoc payments or on a monthly overpayment arrangement.We cannot amend or set up the overpayment arrangement if the mortgage is in the billing cycle, this means 5 working days prior to the monthly mortgage payment being collected. If you wish to cancel this arrangement, you will need to do so at least 7 working days before the payment is due.By making overpayments, the customer will benefit from an interest saving immediately as interest is charged daily. The term of the mortgage may be reduced which can result in the loan being repaid earlier. This will only be achieved if overpayments are continually made throughout the original mortgage term.If monthly payments are reset, they are calculated over the original mortgage term/remaining term.Any projected savings as a result of overpayments are subject to change. The projections are not guaranteed as they are based on the current interest rate, the overpayments against the existing monthly payments, and the remaining term. All of these factors will change.Any changes to the interest rate, payment date, or if the overpayment arrangement stops will result in the standard payments being recalculated over the original term. We will revert to a standard monthly payment (minimum payment) following these changes.If the annual overpayment allowance is set in a leap year, the allowance will not commence on drawdown or amendment, and will instead reset the following working day.Online banking customers can view their overpayment allowance by using the overpayment screen on their mortgage account. This shows the annual allowance amount, the start and end dates for the current period and the allowance balance remaining if overpayments have been paid.Placing an application / Cancelling a caseSubmitting an Additional Borrowing, Porting or Product Switch applicationTo commence an Additional Borrowing, Porting or Product Switch application, select 'Existing customer' from thebroker portalafter logging in.For Additional Borrowing and Product Switch applications you will need to accept the customer offer document on behalf of your client to ensure the application completes.For Porting applications, receipt of the Certificate of Title (COT) auto-triggers the offer acceptance, so you do not have to manually accept it for this type of application.For further information about applications for existing HSBC UK mortgage customers, please take a look at ourFrequently Asked Questions.Cancelling a caseFor all application types you must inform us if you wish to cancel the case.Many of our processes in the application journey are now automated, therefore the case may reach completion if you do not advise us that it should be cancelled.For Product Switch applications only:On the Broker Platform, enter the application reference and use the ‘Cancel application’ option.For all other application types, please call our Broker Support Team on 0345 6005847 (Monday – Friday 9am to 5pm) if you wish to cancel a submitted application.For all Application types where a booking fee has already been paid, this will be refunded within 48 hours.PortingYou can complete a Porting application request on behalf of your customer under the following circumstances:Porting EligibilityYour customer is an existing HSBC UK mortgage customerYour customer is on a Fixed Rate, Term Tracker or Lifetime TrackerThe eligible rate will need to have at least 6 months remainingThe sale and purchase will be completed simultaneouslyIf your customer is looking to port their current product, they will need to be aware of the following exclusions which will result in their application not proceeding:Porting ExclusionsAny account in arrearsMore than six existing loan partsMore than two applicantsPorting a HSBC closed secured loanEquity buy-out (EBO)Marital DisputesWhere there is an existing application in progress (this will include a product switch application)Further InformationFor the total borrowing amount, a procuration fee of 0.4% residential and 0.5% BTL will be paid for the new lending upon completion.You will be able to complete Simultaneous Porting applications, where the existing HSBC mortgage must be repaid simultaneously with the drawdown of the new application.As a Porting application is an onward purchase you can also apply to amend details (subject to meeting eligibility criteria) such as loan term, repayment type, add on an applicant (as long as no more than 2 applicants in total) etc.Product switchingWhen completing a Product Switch application on behalf of your client you will need to accept the customer offer document to ensure the application completes.You can complete a product switch on behalf of your client under the following circumstances:Product Switch EligibilityYour client is an existing HSBC UK mortgage customerYour client is on a Fixed Rate, Term Tracker, Lifetime Tracker or Standard Variable RateIf a joint mortgage where one of the parties has passed away, you are able to complete a product switch for the remaining customer who is the surviving borrower, while the mortgage is still in joint names.

============================================================

A property that wasn’t / isn't being initially purchased for a specific purpose of renting (e.g previous home / inherited property / accidental landlord)


159. ### Affordability for HSBC BTL mortgagescan only be assessed using rental income.
============================================================

In addition to rental income coverage, we will assess personal income when making a lending decision.

Consideration will be given to your customer’s personal commitments so to ensure that the lending remains sustainable in the event of tenancy voids, or where maintenance/repair costs have been incurred.

The application may be declined if we determine that there is insufficient disposable income to support the borrowing, or if the overall exposure is too high.


160. ### Income Cover Ratio (ICR) assessment
============================================================

For basic rate tax payers, we will assess affordability based on the annual rental income, which must be equal to or greater than 125% of the annual Buy to Let mortgage payments, calculated at the stressed rate or product rate, whichever is higher. This takes into account potential future interest rate rises.

Please note that when working out whether a basic or high rate taxpayer, total income should be considered.  This should include rental income that is currently being received along with 75% of any proposed new property rental income (if a BTL Purchase application).

For higher rate tax payers, we will assess affordability based on the annual rental income, which must be equal to or greater than 145% of the annual Buy to Let mortgage payments, calculated at the stressed rate or product rate, whichever is higher.

For joint applicants, both applicants need to be a basic rate tax payer to achieve a stressed rate of 125%, otherwise 145% will be applied if one applicant is a basic rate tax payer and the other applicant a higher rate tax payer.

For applications from non-UK residents, we will assess affordability based on the annual rental income, which must be equal to or greater than 145% of the annual Buy to Let mortgage payments, calculated at the stressed rate or product rate, whichever is higher.

A further check is also required to ensure that the rental payment is sufficient to cover the mortgage payment on a capital repayment basis.
