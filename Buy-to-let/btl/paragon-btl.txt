Purchase application Repayment methods
Property investment clubs and syndicates
Remortgage application
Consumer buy-to-let
Mortgage term
The loan amount will be calculated using the lower of the purchase price or the
current valuation.
All deposit funds must originate from the UK, and we may need proof of the source
of these funds.
Where the whole balance of the purchase price is not coming from the applicants’
own funds, full details will be required.
Interest only, capital and interest repayment, and part interest only and part capital
repayment loans are available.
We will not accept applications where the property is being purchased or refinanced
through, or where the applicant is in anyway connected to, a property investment club
or syndicate.
We will consider remortgage applications where the applicant has been the registered
proprietor for less than six months. However, the loan amount will be based upon the
lower of the purchase price or current valuation.
We may consider using the current valuation where it can be demonstrated, that
since the date of purchase, significant improvement works which have enhanced the
property value have been carried out. In these instances, a schedule of works and
evidence of expenditure will be required.
The property must be registered at the Land Registry (or in Scotland, Registers of
Scotland) as owned by the applicant(s), at the date of completion.
We will accept applications that qualify as consumer buy-to-let mortgage contracts,
if the appropriate criteria is being met.
More information about consumer buy-to-let can be found on our website at
www.paragonbank.co.uk/personal/mortgages/buy-to-let/consumer-buy-to-let
Minimum: 5 years
Maximum: 35 years
The mortgage term for a further advance must match the remaining term of the
existing mortgage.



Income / affordability
Income
We will assess the affordability of a mortgage based on the expected monthly income Affordability generated from letting the property to a tenant. The actual income generated may be
different and can be influenced over time by changes within the rental market.
The applicant(s) will remain responsible for meeting the costs of the mortgage and the
additional costs associated with letting the property for the duration of the mortgage.
Applicants should have a minimum combined gross annual income of £25,000 per annum.
All income must be evidenced and can include:
• gross employment income
• taxable self-employed income
• occupational or private pension income
• state pension income
However, we understand the specialist nature of a landlords’ income structure. So,
where a landlord or limited company has four or more properties, and can’t meet
the £25,000 minimum income, but can demonstrate they have sufficient income to
cover their existing expenditure, we will consider and assess these applications on a
case-by-case basis.
For individuals with three or fewer mortgaged buy-to-let properties:
State benefits, investment income and income derived from Land and Property will
not be considered but may be taken into account when calculating the tax band
applicable to an applicant.
For individuals with four or more mortgaged buy-to-let properties, limited companies
and applications for Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMO) or multi-unit blocks:
State benefits and investment income will not be considered but may be taken into
account when calculating the tax band applicable to an applicant.
The useable income figure in respect of Land and Property income will be derived by
deducting the total amount of ‘residential finance costs’ from the ‘taxable profit for
the year’ figure, in line with current tax calculation requirements. For more information
about this, please see our how to calculate usable income for landlords guide.
Any fees that will be added to the loan will be included in the loan amount used in both
the current and future affordability calculations.
All applications will be subject to validation of:
• The income requirements above
• The gross rental income from the property equalling or exceeding the Interest
Cover Ratio (ICR), as determined using a combination of the tax band applicable
to an applicant’s income and the property type. The tax band applicable to the
applicant with the highest income will be used.
All calculations will be based on either the current reference rate published on our
website and in our product guides, or the product charging rate plus 2%, whichever
is the greater. The exception to this is our five year fixed rate products, which will be
calculated using either the current five year fixed reference rate published on our
website and in our product guides, or the product charging rate, whichever is the
greater. Some products may be subject to an individual reference rate, but where this
is the case, it will be clearly indicated within the product details.
Future affordability will also be taken into account and may limit the maximum loan
amount available. Before submitting an application, please ensure you check how
much we may be able to lend your client by using our online calculator, which can be
found on our website www.paragonbank.co.uk/intermediary/btl
For further advances, the affordability assessment will take into account both the
proposed advance (including fees added to the loan) and the existing loans secured
against the property.
For limited liability partnerships, the tax


### Income / Affordability

The tax band and ICR (Interest Cover Ratio) levels are outlined as follows: Basic rate tax payers (20%) and limited companies require 125% for single self-contained properties and 130% for HMOs, multi-unit blocks, and all other property types, while higher rate tax payers (40%) and additional rate tax payers (45%) require 140% for single self-contained properties and 145% for HMOs, multi-unit blocks, and all other property types. We must be satisfied that the applicant(s) can withstand increases in mortgage interest rates, cover rental voids, and afford the mortgage both now and after any fixed or discounted period expires. We may request evidence of contingency funds to support increased mortgage payments and may decline an application if we believe the applicant will not be able to meet mortgage payments should interest rates increase. The ICR calculation is determined by multiplying the amount of loan by the ICR calculation rate and the ICR tax band percentage, resulting in the minimal rental income required to borrow the requested amount of loan.

Property
Minimum property valuation
Valuations
We will take a first legal charge and will normally consider most types of traditionally
constructed residential property in England, Wales or Scotland.
Further advances will be secured by way of a second charge against the property.
£75,000
A security assessment and valuation report will be arranged as soon as an application
is received. This is to determine the property value, the realistic and sustainable
monthly rental income and the suitability of the property for mortgage purposes.
Although we will provide you with a copy of the valuation, this is for mortgage lending
purposes only. It is not intended to provide a detailed report on the condition of the
property, and if this is required, it should be instructed separately by the applicant to
be carried out by a suitably qualified independent surveyor.
Any property we are considering should be lettable in its current condition.
Properties that are likely to have low demand from tenants due to their current
condition, location or other factors, including poor maintenance or management of
common areas, will not normally be acceptable.
We reserve the right to accept or decline any individual property.
Before completion of the loan, a revaluation will be arranged by us, at the applicant’s
expense, where the initial inspection is more than four months old.
The property must comply with the current Energy Performance Certificate (EPC)
regulation, and have a minimum rating of E, unless there is an applicable exemption.
This will be verified by Paragon and the acting solicitor, and we will not be able to
lend on any property that is found not to be compliant. We will be unable to consider
a further advance application on any property that does not meet the current EPC
regulation. It is the responsibility of the applicant(s) to ensure that the property
remains compliant with the EPC regulation for the duration of the mortgage term.
Multi-unit property
The applicant must have a minimum two years lettings experience as a landlord.
A single property may be divided into a maximum of 20 units and the following
minimum values will apply:
• Up to 10 units, the property value must be greater than or equal to £100,000
• Up to 20 units, the property value must be greater than or equal to £150,000
If more than one unit (house or flat) is held on a single title and each unit is capable of
sale separately, although a valuation based on the total value of all units may be used,
a discounted reflecting the value as a single purchase will be applied.
We will not consider properties where more than 50% of the units are on long leases.
At our discretion, and where considered appropriate, an investment valuation may
be carried out.
Where the property has been purchased in the last 12 months:
• and there has been an uplift in value, it will be subject to a maximum LTV of 70%
• but the property value and lending requirements equate to a like for like
transaction, we may consider lending more than 70%, subject to product criteria
Where the property was purchased more than 12 months ago, and there has been a
significant recent uplift in valuation, we may still limit the advance to a maximum LTV
of 70%.

Solicitors
We will normally instruct the applicant’s solicitors/licensed conveyancers to act on
behalf of both parties provided:
• the firm has a minimum of four partners each holding current practising
certificates/licenses, operates from commercial premises, has been in business
for at least three years, and is currently registered with the Law Society/Council

cover of £4 million or more where the loan amount being applied for is £2 million
or more
• the firm is registered on Lender Exchange, agrees to our terms and conditions,
and has been accepted onto our conveyancing panel
Should an applicant choose a firm that is not acceptable to us, they will act solely for
the applicant. The applicant will then have to select another firm from our panel to act
on our behalf, and any costs incurred from both firms will be the responsibility of the
applicant whether or not completion takes place.
In all cases, we reserve the right to instruct alternative solicitors/licensed
conveyancers to act solely for us and again, any costs incurred from both firms, will
be the responsibility of the applicant(s) whether or not completion takes place.
To see if your solicitor is on our panel of approved firms, please check the Lender
Exchange website.
Property insurance
Index linked buildings insurance will be required to be maintained for the rebuilding
cost of the property.
The applicant(s) must make their own insurance arrangements, and we reserve the
right to request a copy of the insurance policy. The applicant must contribute towards
the cost of contingency insurance taken out by Paragon, to cover any subsequent
loss as a result of any inadequacy of the insurance arranged by them.
All properties must be acceptable to insurers on standard terms ie, exclusions or
increased excesses must not apply.
For leasehold property, the freeholders may already have adequate cover in force
under the terms of the lease.
The solicitor will be required to confirm that the policy meets the minimum
requirements of the mortgage contract, is in force at completion and that, wherever
possible, our interest has been noted on the policy.
Where a higher reinstatement value for the property is confirmed on a further
advance valuation, it will be necessary for the existing buildings insurance cover to
be increased accordingly.

the valuation, which will not be carried out until full details are received.
When the scheduled works are completed, the refurb-to-let loan will then be replaced
with a standard buy-to-let mortgage. You can find details of the products available in
our buy-to-let product guide.
Both the refurbishment loan and buy-to-let mortgage will be assessed and offered at
the same time, which means fee reductions will apply – details of which can be found
in our buy-to-let product guide.
Maximum aggregate borrowing
A normal total mortgage exposure per borrower of £5,000,000 may be advanced to
an applicant on a property portfolio.
Loan purpose
We will generally consider applications for either purchase or remortgage of
residential investment property.
Consumer buy-to-let
We will not consider refurb-to-let applications that qualify as consumer buy-to-let
mortgage contracts.
Mortgage term
Minimum: 1 month
Maximum: 6 months
Repayment methods
Interest only loans with the repayment type of either serviced monthly payments or
gross rolled up interest are available.
Property valuation
Minimum property valuation: £50,000
A security assessment and valuation report will be arranged to determine the
property value, in its present condition at the time of submission.
A fully completed schedule of works will be required prior to valuation and should be
accompanied by as much supporting documentation as possible.
An after works capital value will also be provided, and the property will be assessed
in respect of the realistic and sustainable monthly rental income. Any properties that
are likely to have low demand from tenants due to location or other factors, will not
normally be acceptable.
We reserve the right to accept or decline any individual property.
After completion of the refurbishment loan, we reserve the right to arrange at our
discretion, a revaluation at our expense, to review the progress of works

Offer of loan
Both the refurbishment loan and buy-to-let mortgage will be offered at the
same time.
The refurbishment offer will lapse if completion does not take place within three
calendar months of it being issued.
The buy-to-let mortgage offer is valid for six calendar months from the date
it is issued, allowing the refurbishment loan to complete and the works to be
carried out. Once the works have been finalised, you can then complete on the
buy-to-let mortgage.
Post-completion monitoring
Due to the complex nature and limited timeframe of this borrowing, close contact will
be maintained by a bespoke team of underwriters throughout the term.

However, we understand the specialist nature of a landlord’s income structure.

### Tax Band and ICR Levels

The tax band and ICR levels are as follows: For single self-contained properties, basic rate tax payers (20%) have an ICR of 125%, limited companies have an ICR of 125%, higher rate tax payers (40%) have an ICR of 140%, and additional rate tax payers (45%) have an ICR of 140%. For HMOs, multi-unit blocks, and all other property types, basic rate tax payers (20%) have an ICR of 130%, limited companies have an ICR of 130%, higher rate tax payers (40%) have an ICR of 145%, and additional rate tax payers (45%) have an ICR of 145%. We must be satisfied that the applicant(s) are able to withstand increases in mortgage interest rates, cover rental voids, and be able to afford the mortgage now and after any fixed/discounted period expires. We may request evidence of contingency funds which could be used to support increased mortgage payments. We may decline an application if we believe the applicant will not be able to meet mortgage payments should interest rates increase.
