### Income criteria changes and pipeline update

Employed applicants

Now that the furlough scheme has ended we will consider applicants who have been on furlough provided that they have been back in full time employment for at least 1 full month.

Self-employed applicants

For self-employed applicants, those who can prove consistent and sustainable profit throughout 2020 and 2021, will be assessed in line with our standard self employed criteria. If the Society deems a business has been (or is likely to be) adversely affected by Covid-19, we reserve the right to reduce the assessable income used.

We will require 3 months of business bank account statements in addition to our usual supporting document requirements for all self-employed applicants. Management accounts may also be requested if deemed necessary.

We will contact brokers to confirm the following:

If the applicant has received an offer from the Society we will not proactively request information about any changes in customer s circumstances, however, if there are any significant changes then we would request that we are notified to ensure we continue to lend responsibly.

• The applicant still wishes to proceed with their mortgage application.
• If there has been a significant change in the customer(s) income since the submission of the application. If there has been a significant change we will request confirmation of the relevant details.

### Regulated Buy-to-Let

We will consider applications on a regulated Buy-to-Let product specifically for letting to family members.

We will not currently consider applications from adult children (sons and/or daughters) purchasing their parents' current residence and then renting it back.

Regulated Buy-to-Let applications are considered strictly on an affordability basis. Any rental income received will not be factored into our affordability assessment. We obtain the AST to ensure that if the property converted to a traditional buy to let the gross rent would be at least equal to 125% of the monthly interest payment at the initial pay rate).

Regulated Buy-to-Let applications are assessed in the same way as a standard residential mortgage. The Society stresses the mortgage repayment in order to assess the affordability of the loan in relation to the clients existing outgoings and factoring in the new Buy-to-Let.

The stated expenditure will be reviewed in conjunction with the bank statements and/or with statistical data, as appropriate. Applications will be declined where affordability cannot be proven on realistic expenditure.

The Society will consider applications on an Interest only or repayment basis.

Where the property is let to a family member without an AST the tenant(s) will be required to sign the age 17+ waiver form

## Interim criteria

Employed applicants

Now that the furlough scheme has ended we will consider applicants who have been on furlough provided that they have been back in full time employment for at least 1 full month.

Self-employed applicants

For self-employed applicants, those who can prove consistent and sustainable profit throughout 2020 and 2021, will be assessed in line with our standard self employed criteria. If the Society deems a business has been (or is likely to be) adversely affected by Covid-19, we reserve the right to reduce the assessable income used.

We will require 3 months of business bank account statements in addition to our usual supporting document requirements for all self-employed applicants. Management accounts may also be requested if deemed necessary.

We will contact brokers to confirm the following:

If the applicant has received an offer from the Society we will not proactively request information about any changes in customer s circumstances, however, if there are any significant changes then we would request that we are notified to ensure we continue to lend responsibly.

• The applicant still wishes to proceed with their mortgage application.
• If there has been a significant change in the customer(s) income since the submission of the application. If there has been a significant change we will request confirmation of the relevant details.
