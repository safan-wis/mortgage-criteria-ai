## Buy to Let Rental Calculator | BTL Stress Calculator


# Buy to let rental calculator


## Use our rental calculator to work out the minimum rent required for a Buy to Let Mortgage. If there’s a shortfall it’ll also confirm if top slicing is available for your client and if so, take you to our surplus income calculator.


## Important information

The DIP will assess the affordability using the standard ICR rate so there may be some discrepancy in affordability prior to selecting the product rate at FMA stage.
Following the DIP, we may undertake further checks to assess affordability for your client, which may result in a reduction to the loan amount we are prepared to advance or the loan being declined.
If the declared rental income is
										insufficient to meet the loan requested,
										then it may be possible to increase the
										maximum loan available by either:
- Extending the initial product term
											to 5 years where you have initially
											selected a shorter term, or
- Use surplus income from employment /
											self-employment to cover the rental
											shortfall. This will be subject to
											additional lending criteria and and
											also that the monthly rent covers
											the monthly mortgage commitment
											using the stress rate, by at least
											100%
Straight Switch - If
														your client(s) are
														re-mortgaging with no
														additional borrowing.
Capital Raising/New
														Purchase - If your
														client(s) are looking to
														borrow more.
Please provide details if you
												require the maximum loan amount
Terms of between 5 and 40 years
												are acceptable

*Amount shown will not exceed either the amount entered

# Top Slicing


## The flexibility for your client to use their client income to top up a rental shortfall

## Product Transfers | Accord Buy To Let Mortgages


# Buy to Let Product Transfers


#### All the information on this page relates to accounts beginning 1001. If you need further support please call 0345 848 0224. For support with all other account numbers, please contact 0345 166 9267.


## So your client's current deal is about to come to an end (or they're considering switching deal) and you'd like to see what's available for them. Look no further!


### It’s an easy process, simply select the right deal from our Product Transfer range and complete an online form to request an offer.


## Things to be aware of


### Requesting transfers

You can submit a Transfer Request for your client at any time. If the account number starts 1001 please use the transfer request form below. For all other BTL account numbers, you can use the online portal. Simply select the Product Transfer option when you log in. If you need any support with the online portal, please call 0345 166 9267.
Please note: if this is more than 90 days before the product end date, Early Repayment Charges may apply (see below). If your client hasn't accepted a mortgage illustration offer from Accord 90 days before maturity, we'll write to the borrower directly outlining the ways they can apply for a new product.
Once the transfer request has been submitted we’ll send your client an offer.

### Updates

We’ll let you know by email when the offer has been sent to your client. If you need a copy of the offer please call 0345 166 9267 .
We’ll also let you know if the offer hasn’t been received by us within 9 days of the offer being issued.

### Accepting the offer

Your client has 14 days to accept and return the offer. If they haven’t accepted the offer at this point, we can accept the offer up to 24 days from issue, provided the product is still available. If the product isn’t available at this point, the offer won’t be valid, you’ll need to start again by submitting a new transfer request for a product we do have.

### Completion of the transfer

We’ll switch your client's mortgage to the new product on the date the old product expires to avoid any early repayment charges, unless specifically requested otherwise.
Where product fees are payable and your client isn’t adding it to the loan, then these must be paid prior to completion. They can be paid, either by cheque or over the phone by calling us on 0345 848 0224 .
We’ll write to your client to let them know the product switch has been completed and we’ll also let you know via email.

### Cancellation Policy

- Product switching – Once the product has been agreed for a product transfer, we won't allow clients to switch products between then and completion.
- PT Cancellation – Once the product has been agreed, there is no way to retract that offer without incurring ERCs. These ERCs will be applied automatically at redemption.

## Useful information & Guidance


### Eligibility

- Your client’s mortgages must have been held with us for at least 12 months.
- The client must not be residing in the property.
- There must be less than the value of 1 month's mortgage payment in arrears, up to a maximum amount of £100 at the time of applying for a transfer and completion of transfer.
- There must be no more than one missed or late payment in the last 24 months.

### Term


### Procuration Fee


### Early Repayment Charges


### LTV


### Revaluation Fees

Our transfer product range now takes into account your client's mortgage balance compared to the estimated value of their property. We calculate this estimated value by using our House Price Index, which is recalculated every 3 months. We'll use this valuation when assessing your client's eligibility for our products unless your client requests a revaluation. A revaluation can be requested if your client believes that their property's current value is different to our estimated valuation.
Requesting a revaluation does not reserve any of our mortgage products or interest rates. Products can be withdrawn at any time and your client will only be able to choose from the range available once their current valuation is confirmed.
If a re-valuation is required, a non-refundable fee of £70 is payable. This fee is payable upfront on request of a re-valuation. This can be paid by credit/debit card over the phone.

Important things to remember
- If your client is planning to change the term of their mortgage or the way in which they repay the mortgage as part of the transfer process, and there is more than one applicant, then we'll require identification for each applicant. Please call us on 0345 848 0224 for more information.

### Product fee

Accord offers a range of products to suit different client requirements, some without product fees and some with. For details on product fees please see our product page.

### Initial interest with your first mortgage payment

Your first mortgage payment includes initial interest. This is the interest which is charged from the day we release funds to your solicitor to the end of the calendar month in which interest charging commences - please be aware of this to allow you to budget accordingly.
Three working days after completion we will issue a First Payment Letter which will confirm the amount of initial interest which has been charged, and the date on which the payment will be taken.

### Valuation fees

The valuation will be instructed as soon as the relevant fee has been paid and we begin to process the application - unless you advise us otherwise. Once a valuation has been carried out, the fee will not be refunded in the event that the mortgage does not proceed.

## Buy to Let property inspections


### What’s right for my client?


### The mortgage valuation

The mortgage valuation is solely for our purposes and is used to ensure that the property provides sufficient security to lend.
It important that your client is aware that the valuation IS NOT A SURVEY and does not provide any indication whether the property is worth what is being paid for it, nor does it indicate any necessary repairs or defects. We would strongly recommend that your client obtains a more detailed inspection of the property such as a HomeBuyer Report or Building Survey (see below).

### HomeBuyer report

We can arrange to carry out a HomeBuyer Report for your client at the same time as the mortgage valuation. This report is designed to focus on defects and problems which are considered urgent or significant. A HomeBuyer Report is suitable for properties which are of standard type and construction and appear to be in reasonable condition. Your client will pay us the standard mortgage valuation fee but pay the cost of the homebuyers valuation fee directly to the valuer. Before the valuer carries out the Homebuyers Survey, they will contact your client to discuss the scope of the inspection and cost.

### Building Survey

This type of survey is suitable for all residential properties but may be particularly applicable for period properties, those with extensive accommodation or in a particularly poor state of repair. It can be tailored to your client’s requirements but is a detailed report covering all major and minor defects. There is no standard or scale fee for a Building Survey but the cost can be significantly higher than it is for a HomeBuyer Report.
Although in most cases the cost does not include a mortgage valuation, we can arrange for both to be carried out together. Your client will pay us the standard Mortgage Valuation fee but pay the cost of the Building Survey direct to the valuer. Before the valuer carries out the Building Survey, he will contact your client to discuss the scope of the inspection and the cost.

### Important information which may affect your client

It is important to manage your client's expectations regarding the valuation of their property. In the current housing market, whilst property prices in some regions are increasing, in other regions house prices either continue to fall, or remain flat. This is likely to affect the value of property when your clients apply for a mortgage, and potentially your client's choice of mortgage product.
We obtain a mortgage valuation for all house purchase and remortgage applications. In addition, the valuer appointed will provide us with a rental assessment of the property. As such the mortgage valuation will not necessarily be the same figure as the price which someone might be prepared to pay for the property.
This could result in your client's property being valued at less than you told us and may also mean that your client no longer qualifies for a product with a specific LTV. In the event of this happening your client may be able to switch to another product with a higher LTV, or it may mean that we are unable to offer your client a mortgage. If we are unable to offer a mortgage after the mortgage valuation, any product application or valuation fees will not be refunded, so it is essential you are as accurate as possible when providing us with an estimated value of your client's property. ( Is your valuation lower than expected? )
There are various websites that provide estimates of current property valuations and house prices and we would encourage you to look at these and explore the rental income and demand for the property before telling us your client's property valuation. This will help to ensure the figure that you provide to us is as accurate as possible and increase the chance that the product you select on application is the one you will be able to proceed with following the application.

## Existing customer fees & charges


### Revaluations

A revaluation of your client’s property may be required if they wish to make a change to their existing Accord BTL mortgage such as:
- Existing Borrower Transfer If a re-valuation of your client’s property is required, a non-refundable fee £70 is payable. This fee is payable upfront on request of a re-valuation. This can be paid by credit/debit card over the phone. A revaluation can be requested to estimate the current LTV if your client believes that the current value of the property is different to our estimation. The revaluation does not reserve any of our mortgage products or interest rates and products can be withdrawn at any time.
- Early Repayment Charges If your client decides to repay their mortgage early or they want to switch to a new deal (an Existing Borrower Transfer), there is usually a charge applied. This is normally shown as a percentage of your current mortgage balance.

## Step 2 - Find a product

It’s easy to find the right mortgage for your clients with Accord.
If you’ve already browsed the various sourcing systems then you’ll see we’re well represented. We also provide a handy product finder for quick searching and filtering of products.

## Checklist


## Step 3 - Get a lending decision

We’ll only carry out a soft credit check, so it won’t leave a permanent trace on your client’s credit record. Our lending decision process allows you to give us information about your client so that we can assess their affordability and provide you with a decision.
It’s key that you provide as much information as possible as this contributes to your client’s credit score and the overall decision. An ‘Accept’ lending decision is subject to:
- A satisfactory valuation of the property to be mortgaged.
- The information provided remaining unchanged.
- The information provided during the full mortgage application meeting If your decision is “Accept” or “Refer” then MSO will provide a list of documents we need to support your decision (we may ask for more). Our lending decisions last for 90 days so you’ll need to move onto the full application within that time. After this expires, you’d need to redo the lending decision.

**An Investment Property Loan is a non-consumer Buy to let mortgage that will not be occupied by the borrower or their relatives and has been entered into a predominantly for the purpose of the business.
***If an applicant is letting out another property to a non-family member under a consent to let agreement, this would be considered as owning another property let under a rental agreement

## Portfolio Landlords | About Accord Mortgages | Intermediary only lender


# Portfolio landlords


## In accordance with the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) supervisory statement on Buy to Let underwriting standards in September 2016, Accord will introduce changes to its underwriting approach for landlords who meet the definition of a ‘Portfolio landlord’.


## Definition of a Portfolio landlord

- Portfolio Landlords will be defined as those having 4 or more mortgaged BTL properties.
- The definition is applicable at application level not applicant level. Therefore for 2 landlords applying together, the total number of their individual and joint mortgaged properties will be taken into account.
- We’ll include other applications currently ‘In-flight’ with Accord and other lenders to determine the total number of mortgaged BTL properties.
Portfolio Landlords will be defined as those having 4 or more mortgaged BTL properties.
The definition is applicable at application level not applicant level. Therefore for 2 landlords applying together, the total number of their individual and joint mortgaged properties will be taken into account.
We’ll include other applications currently ‘In-flight’ with Accord and other lenders to determine the total number of mortgaged BTL properties.
Examples:
1: App 1 & 2 have 3 BTL properties in joint names and App 1 has another in sole name
2: App 1 & 2 have 2 BTL properties in joint names
3: App 1 & 2 have 4 BTL mortgages held in joint names and are remortgaging one of these to Accord
4: App 1 & 2 have 2 BTL mortgages in joint names. They’re applying to us to purchase another property and they have an ‘in-flight’ application with another lender
5: App 1 & 2 have 5 BTL properties in joint names, 2 are unencumbered. Applicants are looking to raise funds with Accord on one of the unencumbered properties.
6: App 1 & 2 have 3 BTL properties in joint names which are unencumbered. They’re applying to us to purchase another property.

## What to expect when submitting a Portfolio case

We’ll assess the financial strength and competency of a portfolio landlord by taking into consideration their experience in the buy-to-let market, their full property portfolio and any outstanding mortgages along with their assets and liabilities.
Our existing rental calculations will apply for new borrowing. All background properties must collectively meet a minimum rental calculation of 145% interest coverage ratio (ICR) at a stressed rate of 5.0%.
There are no changes to loan to value (LTV) limits, maximum loan size or minimum income.
We’ve tried to make our portfolio lending criteria as simple and straight forward as possible. In addition to our standard criteria, portfolio landlords will be required to supply details of any applications currently being processed with other lenders and complete an assets statement. We’ll also ask these landlords if they anticipate any financial changes or changes in circumstances which could impact the affordability of their portfolio.

## What do I need to know when submitting a Portfolio case

When providing background BTLs & any inflight applications, you will need to use “Portfolio Manager” within your portal and add this to the case before submission. Please follow this link to use our when submitting a Portfolio case, as the guide will help navigate through a portfolio landlord case, it will give handy Tips and highlight specific steps that must be followed to help submit a portfolio case.
If the application is classified as a ‘Portfolio Landlord’ case, when it reaches ‘Initial Assessment stage’ (the point at which an underwriter is ready to start to review the application), you’ll see that a new document will be available to complete. This document is called ‘Personal Statement of Assets’ . The Underwriter will require you to complete and upload these details so that they can assess the landlords financial strength.
As explained earlier, you’ll notice that the interest coverage ratio (ICR) applied to the combined background portfolio properties will be calculated at 145% @ 5.0% and will be based on ALL background Buy to Let properties in the portfolio. This will include unencumbered properties. All new lending will continue to be calculated with the existing ICR.

## Growth Series Feedback

What is good about the growth series communications is that I feel they are unique from what other lenders are doing. You’re not just pushing your own products, but you are genuinely providing tools which can help us brokers develop our own business, primarily through growing our client banks. It’s a great source of information, primarily marketing based information, which has been created by a lender who clearly understands the needs of us brokers.
Rob Chart, The Finance Planning Group Limited
The whole Growth Series is absolutely invaluable, so thank you for putting this together.
Beth Coupe, White Mortgages Ltd
Thanks to Accord for doing the Growth Series. I think you've done a phenomenal job covering a lot of areas that we wouldn't have necessarily considered. So, great foresight and great support!
Danny Belton, Head of Lender Relationships, MAB
We have found the Growth Series really useful. It is great to see a lender looking to help Brokers with the everyday aspects of growing their businesses rather than focussing on ‘Correct Submission sheet’ type issues which serve to help the lender more than the Broker.
Stuart Powell, Shore
Online review generator, the feedback is I love it, it's easy to use and prompts a customer to leave feedback.
Samantha Allnutt, Howard Financial
7 things brokers can do guide, just wanted to say this is really great stuff.
Robert Gill, The Mortgage Factory
The #GrowthSeries podcast is great! Any broker who is looking to grow their business and embrace the tech revolution should listen to it.
Ashley Borland, Bright Advice
Just a quick email to say how much I’ve enjoyed listening to the Growth Series Podcasts, useful information and tips in each episode and it’s great that support like this is available to us. A big thanks to Accord for this.
Jonathon Evans, Mortgage Advisor, Kevin Ford & Co Ltd
The topic of Professional Indemnity Insurance is being raised in more and more conversations with us currently, including spiralling costs, increases in excesses and underwriters leaving the market. Making sure your business is ready for any future challenges will be key and Accord’s “5 tips for managing the cost of professional indemnity insurance for brokers” is relevant and very sensible advice.
Kevin Roberts, Director L&G Mortgages
I just wished to feedback and say thanks, to you and the team at Accord for the ‘Growth Series’. It as a great development and offers a comprehensive overview on a number of very useful topics. It has helped me remain relevant as a Mortgage Adviser over the last twelve months and allowed my new business levels to grow during the pandemic. The ability to listen to Podcast while continue to work is pertinent for this day and age.
Nick Mills, Mortgage Advisor, RPUK Ltd, Stone, Staffordshire
I'm always super impressed with how engaging Accord are in trying to drive their broker's businesses forward... The Growth Series is really really informative...
Chris Schutrups, Founder and Director, The Mortgage Hut

## Buy to Let Rental Calculator | BTL Stress Calculator


# Buy to let rental calculator


## Use our rental calculator to work out the minimum rent required for a Buy to Let Mortgage. If there’s a shortfall it’ll also confirm if top slicing is available for your client and if so, take you to our surplus income calculator.


## Important information

The DIP will assess the affordability using the standard ICR rate so there may be some discrepancy in affordability prior to selecting the product rate at FMA stage.
Following the DIP, we may undertake further checks to assess affordability for your client, which may result in a reduction to the loan amount we are prepared to advance or the loan being declined.
If the declared rental income is
										insufficient to meet the loan requested,
										then it may be possible to increase the
										maximum loan available by either:
- Extending the initial product term
											to 5 years where you have initially
											selected a shorter term, or
- Use surplus income from employment /
											self-employment to cover the rental
											shortfall. This will be subject to
											additional lending criteria and and
											also that the monthly rent covers
											the monthly mortgage commitment
											using the stress rate, by at least
											100%
Straight Switch - If
														your client(s) are
														re-mortgaging with no
														additional borrowing.
Capital Raising/New
														Purchase - If your
														client(s) are looking to
														borrow more.
Please provide details if you
												require the maximum loan amount
Terms of between 5 and 40 years
												are acceptable
N/A

*Amount shown will not exceed either the amount entered
						in the ´loan required´ field or 80% of the
						declared property value

## Top Slicing | Accord Mortgages


# Top Slicing


## The flexibility for your client to use their client income to top up a rental shortfall

We pride ourselves in being a flexible lender, applying common sense to help brokers help their clients. Being flexible means, we can now help your landlord clients when their rental income doesn’t meet our affordability calculation and use their personal income to ‘top up’ the shortfall.

- Where surplus earned income is being used to cover any rental shortfall (Top Slicing) customers must reside in the same property
- The minimum income not derived from rental properties is £50,000 for both single and joint applications
- The interest coverage ratio based on rental income only must be greater than or equal to 100% and less than the minimum required ICR threshold for the application
- Maximum LTV of 75%
- Not available to First Time Landlords (For an application to be classed as a First Time Landlord, all applicants, at the time of application, do not own a property that they have let out for more than 12 months)
- The security property is not a new build property
- Not available on Let To Buy Applications
- Not available if your applicant is capital raising for unsecured debt consolidation or to cover other personal expenditure (e.g. Car Purchase, Holiday, School fees, Gift to relative).

## BTL in Scotland | Accord Mortgages


# BTL in Scotland

We’ve extended our reach further north and now lend in Scotland! So, if your landlord client has a property in Scotland or even a New Build our BTL product range is available for them to choose from. And, if you’re client needs to use some of their surplus income to ‘top up’ a rental shortfall, we do Top Slicing too. See our policy on New Build here, or our policy on Top Slicing here .
It’s important to note that different income thresholds apply within our rental calculator for lending in Scotland. So, we’ll treat any applicant with a taxable income more than £43,663 as a high rate taxpayer for rental stress testing.

## Eligibility:

- A standard mortgage valuation will be required
- Maximum of 2 individuals on a single tenancy agreement
- In order for a property to be deemed as acceptable security, it must have a minimum Energy Performance Rating of E
- The property must be let under a a single Assured Tenancy, a single Short Assured Tenancy (SAT) or a single Private Residential Tenancy (PRT)
- Acceptable Tenure in Scotland: Absolute & Outright Ownership.

## Product Transfers | Accord Buy To Let Mortgages


# Buy to Let Product Transfers


#### All the information on this page relates to accounts beginning 1001. If you need further support please call 0345 848 0224. For support with all other account numbers, please contact 0345 166 9267.


## So your client's current deal is about to come to an end (or they're considering switching deal) and you'd like to see what's available for them. Look no further!


### It’s an easy process, simply select the right deal from our Product Transfer range and complete an online form to request an offer.


## Things to be aware of


### Requesting transfers

You can submit a Transfer Request for your client at any time. If the account number starts 1001 please use the transfer request form below. For all other BTL account numbers, you can use the online portal. Simply select the Product Transfer option when you log in. If you need any support with the online portal, please call 0345 166 9267.
Please note: if this is more than 90 days before the product end date, Early Repayment Charges may apply (see below). If your client hasn't accepted a mortgage illustration offer from Accord 90 days before maturity, we'll write to the borrower directly outlining the ways they can apply for a new product.
Once the transfer request has been submitted we’ll send your client an offer.

### Updates

We’ll let you know by email when the offer has been sent to your client. If you need a copy of the offer please call 0345 166 9267 .
We’ll also let you know if the offer hasn’t been received by us within 9 days of the offer being issued.

### Accepting the offer

Your client has 14 days to accept and return the offer. If they haven’t accepted the offer at this point, we can accept the offer up to 24 days from issue, provided the product is still available. If the product isn’t available at this point, the offer won’t be valid, you’ll need to start again by submitting a new transfer request for a product we do have.

### Completion of the transfer

We’ll switch your client's mortgage to the new product on the date the old product expires to avoid any early repayment charges, unless specifically requested otherwise.
Where product fees are payable and your client isn’t adding it to the loan, then these must be paid prior to completion. They can be paid, either by cheque or over the phone by calling us on 0345 848 0224 .
We’ll write to your client to let them know the product switch has been completed and we’ll also let you know via email.

### Cancellation Policy

- Product switching – Once the product has been agreed for a product transfer, we won't allow clients to switch products between then and completion.
- PT Cancellation – Once the product has been agreed, there is no way to retract that offer without incurring ERCs. These ERCs will be applied automatically at redemption.

## Useful information & Guidance


### Eligibility

- Your client’s mortgages must have been held with us for at least 12 months.
- The client must not be residing in the property.
- There must be less than the value of 1 month's mortgage payment in arrears, up to a maximum amount of £100 at the time of applying for a transfer and completion of transfer.

### Term


### Procuration Fee


### Early Repayment Charges


### LTV


### Revaluation Fees

Our transfer product range now takes into account your client's mortgage balance compared to the estimated value of their property. We calculate this estimated value by using our House Price Index, which is recalculated every 3 months. We'll use this valuation when assessing your client's eligibility for our products unless your client requests a revaluation. A revaluation can be requested if your client believes that their property's current value is different to our estimated valuation.
Requesting a revaluation does not reserve any of our mortgage products or interest rates. Products can be withdrawn at any time and your client will only be able to choose from the range available once their current valuation is confirmed.
If a re-valuation is required, a non-refundable fee of £70 is payable. This fee is payable upfront on request of a re-valuation. This can be paid by credit/debit card over the phone.

Important things to remember
- If your client is planning to change the term of their mortgage or the way in which they repay the mortgage as part of the transfer process, and there is more than one applicant, then we'll require identification for each applicant. Please call us on 0345 848 0224 for more information.

## Information for Solicitors acting for Accord Mortgages in a Buy to Let mortgage

This section contains information for solicitors . It is designed to address the most common queries we receive from our instructed legal advisers, and those legal advisers dealing with the administration of estates.
Members of the public should consult a qualified legal practitioner before acting on the basis of any information contained in these pages.

### Evidence of Registration


### Present Position

We require our instructed solicitor to send us an official copy of the register entries and any filed plan, to confirm our charge has been registered. We also require you to send us the original, or a certified copy, of the completed mortgage deed.
This documentation will be scanned and held electronically by us. Solicitors are instructed to release any other title documents to our borrower or retain them on their client’s behalf.
Solicitors should take the borrower’s instructions regarding any other title documents. When these are delivered to a borrower, the borrower should be advised that the documents may be required in the future and should therefore be kept in a safe place so that they can be handed over to any subsequent buyer.
Please note Accord Buy to Let does not receive confirmation of registration of its charge from the Land Registry.

The attestation clause that is used is:

### Initial interest with your first mortgage payment

Your first mortgage payment includes initial interest. This is the interest which is charged from the day we release funds to your solicitor to the end of the calendar month in which interest charging commences - please be aware of this to allow you to budget accordingly.

The valuation will be instructed as soon as the relevant fee has been paid and we begin to process the application - unless you advise us otherwise. Once a valuation has been carried out, the fee will not be refunded in the event that the mortgage does not proceed.

### What’s right for my client?


### The mortgage valuation

The mortgage valuation is solely for our purposes and is used to ensure that the property provides sufficient security to lend.
It important that your client is aware that the valuation IS NOT A SURVEY and does not provide any indication whether the property is worth what is being paid for it, nor does it indicate any necessary repairs or defects. We would strongly recommend that your client obtains a more detailed inspection of the property such as a HomeBuyer Report or Building Survey (see below).

### HomeBuyer report

We can arrange to carry out a HomeBuyer Report for your client at the same time as the mortgage valuation. This report is designed to focus on defects and problems which are considered urgent or significant. A HomeBuyer Report is suitable for properties which are of standard type and construction and appear to be in reasonable condition. Your client will pay us the standard mortgage valuation fee but pay the cost of the homebuyers valuation fee directly to the valuer. Before the valuer carries out the Homebuyers Survey, they will contact your client to discuss the scope of the inspection and cost.

### Building Survey

This type of survey is suitable for all residential properties but may be particularly applicable for period properties, those with extensive accommodation or in a particularly poor state of repair. It can be tailored to your client’s requirements but is a detailed report covering all major and minor defects. There is no standard or scale fee for a Building Survey but the cost can be significantly higher than it is for a HomeBuyer Report.
Although in most cases the cost does not include a mortgage valuation, we can arrange for both to be carried out together. Your client will pay us the standard Mortgage Valuation fee but pay the cost of the Building Survey direct to the valuer. Before the valuer carries out the Building Survey, he will contact your client to discuss the scope of the inspection and the cost.

### Important information which may affect your client

It is important to manage your client's expectations regarding the valuation of their property. In the current housing market, whilst property prices in some regions are increasing, in other regions house prices either continue to fall, or remain flat. This is likely to affect the value of property when your clients apply for a mortgage, and potentially your client's choice of mortgage product.
We obtain a mortgage valuation for all house purchase and remortgage applications. In addition, the valuer appointed will provide us with a rental assessment of the property. As such the mortgage valuation will not necessarily be the same figure as the price which someone might be prepared to pay for the property.
This could result in your client's property being valued at less than you told us and may also mean that your client no longer qualifies for a product with a specific LTV. In the event of this happening your client may be able to switch to another product with a higher LTV, or it may mean that we are unable to offer your client a mortgage. If we are unable to offer a mortgage after the mortgage valuation, any product application or valuation fees will not be refunded, so it is essential you are as accurate as possible when providing us with an estimated value of your client's property. ( Is your valuation lower than expected? )
There are various websites that provide estimates of current property valuations and house prices and we would encourage you to look at these and explore the rental income and demand for the property before telling us your client's property valuation. This will help to ensure the figure that you provide to us is as accurate as possible and increase the chance that the product you select on application is the one you will be able to proceed with following the application.

## Existing customer fees & charges


### Revaluations

A revaluation of your client’s property may be required if they wish to make a change to their existing Accord BTL mortgage such as:
- Existing Borrower Transfer If a re-valuation of your client’s property is required, a non-refundable fee £70 is payable. This fee is payable upfront on request of a re-valuation. This can be paid by credit/debit card over the phone. A revaluation can be requested to estimate the current LTV if your client believes that the current value of the property is different to our estimation. The revaluation does not reserve any of our mortgage products or interest rates and products can be withdrawn at any time.
- Early Repayment Charges If your client decides to repay their mortgage early or they want to switch to a new deal (an Existing Borrower Transfer), there is usually a charge applied. This is normally shown as a percentage of your current mortgage balance.

## Checklist


## Step 3 - Get a lending decision

We’ll only carry out a soft credit check, so it won’t leave a permanent trace on your client’s credit record. Our lending decision process allows you to give us information about your client so that we can assess their affordability and provide you with a decision.
It’s key that you provide as much information as possible as this contributes to your client’s credit score and the overall decision. An ‘Accept’ lending decision is subject to:
- A satisfactory valuation of the property to be mortgaged.
- The information provided remaining unchanged.
- The information provided during the full mortgage application meeting If your decision is “Accept” or “Refer” then MSO will provide a list of documents we need to support your decision (we may ask for more). Our lending decisions last for 90 days so you’ll need to move onto the full application within that time. After this expires, you’d need to redo the lending decision.

**An Investment Property Loan is a non-consumer Buy to let mortgage that will not be occupied by the borrower or their relatives and has been entered into a predominantly for the purpose of the business.

## Portfolio Landlords | About Accord Mortgages | Intermediary only lender


# Portfolio landlords


## In accordance with the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) supervisory statement on Buy to Let underwriting standards in September 2016, Accord will introduce changes to its underwriting approach for landlords who meet the definition of a ‘Portfolio landlord’.


## Definition of a Portfolio landlord

- Portfolio Landlords will be defined as those having 4 or more mortgaged BTL properties.
- The definition is applicable at application level not applicant level. Therefore for 2 landlords applying together, the total number of their individual and joint mortgaged properties will be taken into account.
- We’ll include other applications currently ‘In-flight’ with Accord and other lenders to determine the total number of mortgaged BTL properties.
Portfolio Landlords will be defined as those having 4 or more mortgaged BTL properties.
The definition is applicable at application level not applicant level. Therefore for 2 landlords applying together, the total number of their individual and joint mortgaged properties will be taken into account.
We’ll include other applications currently ‘In-flight’ with Accord and other lenders to determine the total number of mortgaged BTL properties.
Examples:
1: App 1 & 2 have 3 BTL properties in joint names and App 1 has another in sole name
2: App 1 & 2 have 2 BTL properties in joint names
3: App 1 & 2 have 4 BTL mortgages held in joint names and are remortgaging one of these to Accord
4: App 1 & 2 have 2 BTL mortgages in joint names. They’re applying to us to purchase another property and they have an ‘in-flight’ application with another lender
5: App 1 & 2 have 5 BTL properties in joint names, 2 are unencumbered. Applicants are looking to raise funds with Accord on one of the unencumbered properties.
6: App 1 & 2 have 3 BTL properties in joint names which are unencumbered. They’re applying to us to purchase another property.

## What to expect when submitting a Portfolio case

We’ll assess the financial strength and competency of a portfolio landlord by taking into consideration their experience in the buy-to-let market, their full property portfolio and any outstanding mortgages along with their assets and liabilities.
Our existing rental calculations will apply for new borrowing. All background properties must collectively meet a minimum rental calculation of 145% interest coverage ratio (ICR) at a stressed rate of 5.0%.
There are no changes to loan to value (LTV) limits, maximum loan size or minimum income.
We’ve tried to make our portfolio lending criteria as simple and straight forward as possible. In addition to our standard criteria, portfolio landlords will be required to supply details of any applications currently being processed with other lenders and complete an assets statement. We’ll also ask these landlords if they anticipate any financial changes or changes in circumstances which could impact the affordability of their portfolio.

## What do I need to know when submitting a Portfolio case

When providing background BTLs & any inflight applications, you will need to use “Portfolio Manager” within your portal and add this to the case before submission. Please follow this link to use our when submitting a Portfolio case, as the guide will help navigate through a portfolio landlord case, it will give handy Tips and highlight specific steps that must be followed to help submit a portfolio case.
If the application is classified as a ‘Portfolio Landlord’ case, when it reaches ‘Initial Assessment stage’ (the point at which an underwriter is ready to start to review the application), you’ll see that a new document will be available to complete. This document is called ‘Personal Statement of Assets’ . The Underwriter will require you to complete and upload these details so that they can assess the landlords financial strength.
As explained earlier, you’ll notice that the interest coverage ratio (ICR) applied to the combined background portfolio properties will be calculated at 145% @ 5.0% and will be based on ALL background Buy to Let properties in the portfolio. This will include unencumbered properties. All new lending will continue to be calculated with the existing ICR.

## FAQ’s

- Are you changing the maximum number of properties allowed in the portfolio? There is no limit to the total number of properties allowed in a portfolio. The maximum number of properties that can be mortgaged remains at 10.
- Are inflight applications included in the total allowable number of portfolio properties? Yes, we include inflight applications in the total number of mortgaged properties; and as part of the rental calculation.
- What rental stress test will be applied on the portfolio? The interest coverage ratio (ICR) for portfolios will be 145% of 5.0%
- What is the overall maximum LTV allowed on the portfolio? We don’t assess the LTV at portfolio level.
- Do unencumbered properties count when defining whether an applicant is classed as a portfolio landlord? No, unencumbered properties are not included. However, the rent from unencumbered properties is included in the background rental calculation.
- Is there a maximum LTV applied on individual units in the portfolio? We won't assess the LTV on any portfolio properties, only the new loan being applied for. We’ll look at LTVs in respect of the overall quality of an application.

## Growth Series Feedback

What is good about the growth series communications is that I feel they are unique from what other lenders are doing. You’re not just pushing your own products, but you are genuinely providing tools which can help us brokers develop our own business, primarily through growing our client banks. It’s a great source of information, primarily marketing based information, which has been created by a lender who clearly understands the needs of us brokers.
Rob Chart, The Finance Planning Group Limited
The whole Growth Series is absolutely invaluable, so thank you for putting this together.
Beth Coupe, White Mortgages Ltd
Thanks to Accord for doing the Growth Series. I think you've done a phenomenal job covering a lot of areas that we wouldn't have necessarily considered. So, great foresight and great support!
Danny Belton, Head of Lender Relationships, MAB
We have found the Growth Series really useful. It is great to see a lender looking to help Brokers with the everyday aspects of growing their businesses rather than focussing on ‘Correct Submission sheet’ type issues which serve to help the lender more than the Broker.
Stuart Powell, Shore
Online review generator, the feedback is I love it, it's easy to use and prompts a customer to leave feedback.
Samantha Allnutt, Howard Financial
7 things brokers can do guide, just wanted to say this is really great stuff.
Robert Gill, The Mortgage Factory
The #GrowthSeries podcast is great! Any broker who is looking to grow their business and embrace the tech revolution should listen to it.
Ashley Borland, Bright Advice
Just a quick email to say how much I’ve enjoyed listening to the Growth Series Podcasts, useful information and tips in each episode and it’s great that support like this is available to us. A big thanks to Accord for this.
Jonathon Evans, Mortgage Advisor, Kevin Ford & Co Ltd
The topic of Professional Indemnity Insurance is being raised in more and more conversations with us currently, including spiralling costs, increases in excesses and underwriters leaving the market. Making sure your business is ready for any future challenges will be key and Accord’s “5 tips for managing the cost of professional indemnity insurance for brokers” is relevant and very sensible advice.
Kevin Roberts, Director L&G Mortgages
I just wished to feedback and say thanks, to you and the team at Accord for the ‘Growth Series’. It as a great development and offers a comprehensive overview on a number of very useful topics. It has helped me remain relevant as a Mortgage Adviser over the last twelve months and allowed my new business levels to grow during the pandemic. The ability to listen to Podcast while continue to work is pertinent for this day and age.
Nick Mills, Mortgage Advisor, RPUK Ltd, Stone, Staffordshire
I'm always super impressed with how engaging Accord are in trying to drive their broker's businesses forward... The Growth Series is really really informative...

## Portfolio landlord BTL criteria

Lending criteria

# Portfolio landlord


### Page contents


## Portfolio landlord definition

Definition of a Portfolio landlord
- Portfolio landlords will be defined as those having 4 or more mortgaged BTL properties.
- The definition is applicable at application level not applicant level. Therefore for 2 landlords applying together, the total number of their individual and joint mortgaged properties will be taken into account.
- We’ll include other applications currently ‘In-flight’ with Accord and other lenders to determine the total number of mortgaged BTL properties.
Examples:
1: App 1 and 2 have 3 BTL properties in joint names and App 1 has another in sole name
2: App 1 and 2 have 2 BTL properties in joint names
3: App 1 and 2 have 4 BTL mortgages held in joint names and are remortgaging one of these to Accord
4: App 1 and 2 have 2 BTL mortgages in joint names. They’re applying to us to purchase another property and they have an ‘in-flight’ application with another lender
5: App 1 and 2 have 5 BTL properties in joint names, 2 are unencumbered. Applicants are looking to raise funds with Accord on one of the unencumbered properties.
6: App 1 and 2 have 3 BTL properties in joint names which are unencumbered.  They’re applying to us to purchase another property.
We’ll assess the financial strength and competency of a portfolio landlord by taking into consideration their experience in the buy-to-let market, their full property portfolio and any outstanding mortgages along with their assets and liabilities.
Our existing rental calculations will apply for new borrowing. All background properties must collectively meet a minimum rental calculation of 145% interest coverage ratio (ICR) at a stressed rate of 5.0%.
In addition to our standard criteria, portfolio landlords will be required to supply details of any applications currently being processed with other lenders and complete an assets statement. We’ll also ask these landlords if they anticipate any financial changes or changes in circumstances which could impact the affordability of their portfolio.

## Portfolio lending limits

Maximum portfolio lending Maximum Group BTL exposure to an individual is £1,000,000 for a first time landlord and £3,000,000 for an experienced landlord.
Maximum total exposure - no limit to the total number of properties (max. 10 with mortgages).
Maximum number of Group BTL loans is 3 for first time landlords and 5 for experienced landlords.
Maximum properties in portfolio We do not have a maximum number of properties allowed in a portfolio. However, no more than 10 properties in the portfolio can be mortgaged.
Is there a maximum LTV applied on individual units in the portfolio? We won't assess the LTV on any portfolio properties, only the new loan being applied for. We'll look at LTVs in respect of the overall quality of an application.
Maximum LTV on portfolio We don't assess the LTV at portfolio level.
Are inflight applications included in the total allowable number of portfolio properties? No, we only count inflight applications when assessing whether the applicant is a portfolio landlord or not. Inflight applications will not count towards the total number of properties you are allowed and won’t be included in our rental calculation.

## Background BTL portfolio

All background properties must collectively meet a minimum rental calculation of 145% interest coverage ratio (ICR) at a stressed rate of 5.0%.
How we assess coverage When reviewing a BTL portfolio we do individually assess properties, but where an individual property in the portfolio doesn’t meet the 145% rule, but other properties in the portfolio would cover the shortfall, we do consider the portfolio as a whole.
Examples:

#### Strong Portfolio

Self-financing 150%: Self-financing 146%
Whilst property 4 is not meeting the 145% rule, collectively the remaining properties are self-financing by 153%.
This is sufficient to cover the shortfall, pulling up the portfolio collectively to 150%.

#### Weak Portfolio

Self-financing 145%: Self-financing 137%
The portfolio as a whole is not meeting the 145% rule, and whilst one property is above the required 145%, this is not by a substantial amount.

# Rental coverage


### Page contents


## Rental coverage

Please use the rental calculator to check the rental coverage you need before you submit an application. Our Interest coverage ratio (ICR) is calculated based on property tenure, mortgage type and term. The rental figure is based on an unfurnished property and must be confirmed by the valuer.
To calculate the maximum borrowing available, we take the lower of the rent received or how much a valuer thinks the property will rent for.
We apply different ICRs dependant on circumstances, these are as follows:
Applicant Tax rate: Product term
Basic rate*: < 5 years
Basic rate*: >= 5 years
Higher rate**: < 5 years
Higher rate**: >= 5 years
*Basic rate taxpayer: Where all applicants on the application have a taxable income of no more than £50,271 in England and Wales/£43,663 in Scotland AND are basic rate taxpayers or pay 0% tax after completion of the application.
**Higher Rate Taxpayer: Applications where at least 1 applicant has a taxable income greater than £50,271 in England and Wales/£43,663 in Scotland and/or those which are higher rate taxpayers or additional rate taxpayers after completion of the application.

## Rental valuation

The rental value figure must be on an unfurnished gross monthly basis on an Assured Short hold tenancy for 6 months or on a proper tenancy if the rent is over £100,000 pa (equivalents in Scotland and Wales).  There must be good demand for rental property in the area concerned.

## Top slicing

We may be able to use surplus personal income (top slicing) to cover a rental shortfall when we assess affordability for a BTL loan.
In order for your application to qualify for top slicing the following criteria should be met:
- Where surplus earned income is being used to cover any rental shortfall (Top Slicing) customers must reside at the same address.
- For single and joint applicants, the minimum income (not from rental properties) is £50,000.
- The interest coverage ratio based on rental income only must be greater than or equal to 100% and less than the minimum required ICR threshold for the application as set out in this policy
- Maximum LTV of 75%
Top slicing is not allowed in these cases:
- Lending to first time landlords
- Lending where the security is a new build property
- Let To Buy applications
- Capital raising for unsecured debt consolidation or to cover other personal expenditure (e.g. Car Purchase, Holiday, School fees, Gift to relative).
To see a breakdown of the types of income we accept and the evidence required, please see our income and top slicing criteria page .

## Portfolio BTL criteria

Lending criteria

# Portfolio


### Page contents


## Portfolio landlord definition

Definition of a Portfolio landlord
- Portfolio landlords will be defined as those having 4 or more mortgaged BTL properties.
- The definition is applicable at application level not applicant level. Therefore for 2 landlords applying together, the total number of their individual and joint mortgaged properties will be taken into account.
- We’ll include other applications currently ‘In-flight’ with Accord and other lenders to determine the total number of mortgaged BTL properties.
Examples:
1: App 1 and 2 have 3 BTL properties in joint names and App 1 has another in sole name
2: App 1 and 2 have 2 BTL properties in joint names
3: App 1 and 2 have 4 BTL mortgages held in joint names and are remortgaging one of these to Accord
4: App 1 and 2 have 2 BTL mortgages in joint names. They’re applying to us to purchase another property and they have an ‘in-flight’ application with another lender
5: App 1 and 2 have 5 BTL properties in joint names, 2 are unencumbered. Applicants are looking to raise funds with Accord on one of the unencumbered properties.
6: App 1 and 2 have 3 BTL properties in joint names which are unencumbered.  They’re applying to us to purchase another property.
We’ll assess the financial strength and competency of a portfolio landlord by taking into consideration their experience in the buy-to-let market, their full property portfolio and any outstanding mortgages along with their assets and liabilities.
Our existing rental calculations will apply for new borrowing. All background properties must collectively meet a minimum rental calculation of 145% interest coverage ratio (ICR) at a stressed rate of 5.0%.
In addition to our standard criteria, portfolio landlords will be required to supply details of any applications currently being processed with other lenders and complete an assets statement. We’ll also ask these landlords if they anticipate any financial changes or changes in circumstances which could impact the affordability of their portfolio.

## Portfolio lending limits

Maximum portfolio lending Maximum Group BTL exposure to an individual is £1,000,000 for a first time landlord and £3,000,000 for an experienced landlord.
Maximum total exposure - no limit to the total number of properties (max. 10 with mortgages).
Maximum number of Group BTL loans is 3 for first time landlords and 5 for experienced landlords.
Maximum properties in portfolio We do not have a maximum number of properties allowed in a portfolio. However, no more than 10 properties in the portfolio can be mortgaged.
Is there a maximum LTV applied on individual units in the portfolio? We won't assess the LTV on any portfolio properties, only the new loan being applied for. We'll look at LTVs in respect of the overall quality of an application.
Maximum LTV on portfolio We don't assess the LTV at portfolio level.
Are inflight applications included in the total allowable number of portfolio properties? No, we only count inflight applications when assessing whether the applicant is a portfolio landlord or not. Inflight applications will not count towards the total number of properties you are allowed and won’t be included in our rental calculation.

## Background BTL portfolio

All background properties must collectively meet a minimum rental calculation of 145% interest coverage ratio (ICR) at a stressed rate of 5.0%.
How we assess coverage When reviewing a BTL portfolio we do individually assess properties, but where an individual property in the portfolio doesn’t meet the 145% rule, but other properties in the portfolio would cover the shortfall, we do consider the portfolio as a whole.
Examples:

#### Strong Portfolio

Self-financing 150%: Self-financing 146%
Whilst property 4 is not meeting the 145% rule, collectively the remaining properties are self-financing by 153%.
This is sufficient to cover the shortfall, pulling up the portfolio collectively to 150%.

#### Weak Portfolio

Self-financing 145%: Self-financing 137%
The portfolio as a whole is not meeting the 145% rule, and whilst one property is above the required 145%, this is not by a substantial amount.

- Any flats that exceed 4 storeys must have adequate lift arrangements.

## Energy performance certificate

In order for a property to be deemed as acceptable security, it must have a minimum Energy Performance Rating of E, unless the property has a valid exemption.
A valuation report will only be returned if the property has a valid EPC with a rating of A – E.  If the valuation has an EPC below E and does not have a valid exemption, the property is deemed unsuitable for our security and the application will be declined. To find whether a property in England or Wales has a valid exemption, the property can be checked on the GOV.UK PRS exemptions register .

## Solar panels

Solar panels are acceptable subject to a satisfactory valuation being returned.  Please note some restrictions may apply to solar panels that were previously installed free of charge and have certain lease restrictions, please contact our support team or your business development manager for queries of this nature.

## Cladding

Where the valuer has requested an EWS1 form due to the cladding being present on the property the following guidance will apply.
A completed EWS1 form will be required from a member of a relevant professional body, along with a covering letter on headed paper which will confirm they are suitably qualified. This will then be assessed by our underwriters.
If an EWS1 form is not available for a new build property a letter from the developer can now be accepted. This is subject to the letter being on a headed letter with the developer’s company details clearly present. The letter must confirm that the property is being built in accordance with the Building (Amendment) Regulations SI 2018/1230 and/or, that there are no materials included in the building of the flats that would cause an EWS1 form to be unsuitable.

## Japanese knotweed

If Japanese knotweed is present at the property, the valuer must confirm what category/stage the knotweed is at and the following rules must be applied;
Category A and B – The property may be considered as acceptable for mortgage purposes, subject to an inspection by a suitably qualified remediation specialist and commitment shown to the commencement of any recommended works under an insurance backed Japanese Knotweed Management Plan Category C and D – Acceptable to lend
If the valuer identifies a heavy stand of Japanese knotweed on neighbouring land (eg very close to the boundary) that may present a threat, the subject property should be declined.

## Minimum property value

The minimum property valuation is £75,000 (in current condition). The property must be suitable for immediate letting at the time of valuation.
The minimum property valuation for new build properties is £100,000.

## Reports and retentions

Where a valuer requests specialist reports, such reports will be referred to the valuer for analysis and comment prior to any offer being issued. No funds will be released until the property has been confirmed as suitable for lending.
Accord BTL will not hold any retentions for works to be completed. The property must be suitable for immediate letting at the time of the valuers inspection.

## Exposure limits

Maximum exposure to any block of flats or development is limited to 25%. A maximum of 1 flat/unit will be acceptable as security in all buildings made up of 4 or less flats/units. The 25% exposure limit will also continue to apply for blocks greater than 4.

## Buildings insurance

Suitable buildings insurance must be in place at completion (remortgage) or at exchange (purchase). The insurer must be aware that the property is to be let. Our interest must be noted in the policy.

## Inter-family purchase

At the time of application the customer must have owned the property for a minimum of 6 months. There is no minimum period of ownership when a property has been inherited.

## Inherited properties

There is no minimum period of ownership when a property has been inherited.

## Overriding interest

We will not consider applications where:
- The property is being sold by a family member at a discounted price.
- A previous owner retains an interest in the security.
- Any tenant retains or may acquire an overriding interest in the property.

## Flying freehold

Flying Freehold is only acceptable where it is 15%  or less of the whole property footprint.

## Steel framed properties

An Intrusive Structural Report (in accordance with BRE113) must be obtained on all pre-1980 Steel.

## Mundic

Mundic Properties are of concrete block construction, often found in Cornwall and Devon. Concrete deteriorates and in the worst cases the property may need to be demolished.
If a test is required by the valuer this must be obtained before mortgage offer. We consider the gradings as follows: A -  Acceptable A/B -  Should be referred to the valuer to check it doesn’t affect his valuation B and below -  Not acceptable

- For flats and maisonettes: where the builder's incentive is cash back or deposit paid, this is not acceptable unless the full incentive is deducted from the purchase price to calculate the loan to value. Any other incentives must not exceed 5%

## Acceptable warranties for new builds

Acceptable new build warranties are:
- NHBC
- Premier Guarantee
- LABC
- Building Life Plans (BLP)

These properties are acceptable once we have a satisfactory report from the valuer confirming their saleability and demand.
Ideally, the property should be approved under (BOPAS) Buildoffsite Property Assurance Scheme which means that it has passed a 60 year durability assessment and has a 12 year structural warranty.
Acceptability will be reviewed by the Group’s valuers based upon:
- Planning/Building Regulation compliance or Professional Consultants Certificate in standard CML format
- Eligibility for buildings insurance cover on normal terms
- Acceptability to other mainstream lenders
- 60 years minimum design life assessment tested by a British  accredited body (i.e. BBA or BRE)

## Buy to Let Rental Calculator | BTL Stress Calculator


# Buy to let rental calculator


## Use our rental calculator to work out the minimum rent required for a Buy to Let Mortgage. If there’s a shortfall it’ll also confirm if top slicing is available for your client and if so, take you to our surplus income calculator.


## Important information

The DIP will assess the affordability using the standard ICR rate so there may be some discrepancy in affordability prior to selecting the product rate at FMA stage.
Following the DIP, we may undertake further checks to assess affordability for your client, which may result in a reduction to the loan amount we are prepared to advance or the loan being declined.
If the declared rental income is
										insufficient to meet the loan requested,
										then it may be possible to increase the
										maximum loan available by either:
- Extending the initial product term
											to 5 years where you have initially
											selected a shorter term, or
- Use surplus income from employment /
											self-employment to cover the rental
											shortfall. This will be subject to
											additional lending criteria and and
											also that the monthly rent covers
											the monthly mortgage commitment
											using the stress rate, by at least
											100%
Straight Switch - If
														your client(s) are
														re-mortgaging with no
														additional borrowing.
Capital Raising/New
														Purchase - If your
														client(s) are looking to
														borrow more.
Please provide details if you
												require the maximum loan amount
Terms of between 5 and 40 years
												are acceptable

# WELCOME TO ACCORD MORTGAGES


## About us

Read on to find out who we are and how we can help you & your clients

### We care because you do

At Accord, we know just how much you value your clients. You know them personally and you’re passionate about going the extra mile to help them. That's why we’re committed to supporting you to strengthen your relationships with them.
Jeremy Duncombe, Director of Intermediary Distribution at Accord Mortgages said:

### Why work with us

We know that being a great lender is about more than just offering competitive products, so here are 3 reasons why Accord could be the lender for you:
- We’ve worked hard to improve by making the application process as simple as possible, getting rid of paperwork where we can and giving you direct access to our underwriters. We’re also making the biggest ever investment in our technology, which you’ll see over the coming months.
- We know that sometimes life isn’t straight-forward, so we always use a common-sense approach to our underwriting. This means that we’ll always try to find a way to lend where it makes sense.
- We’re also dedicated to supporting you to develop your business. Our Growth Series content hub gives free access to blogs, podcasts and practical guides to help you get information on topics such as recruitment and marketing as well as providing valuable insight from key players in the industry.

## About us

Read on to find out who we are and how we can help you & your clients

### We care because you do

At Accord, we know just how much you value your clients. You know them personally and you’re passionate about going the extra mile to help them. That's why we’re committed to supporting you to strengthen your relationships with them.
Jeremy Duncombe, Director of Intermediary Distribution at Accord Mortgages said:

### Why work with us

We know that being a great lender is about more than just offering competitive products, so here are 3 reasons why Accord could be the lender for you:
- We’ve worked hard to improve by making the application process as simple as possible, getting rid of paperwork where we can and giving you direct access to our underwriters. We’re also making the biggest ever investment in our technology, which you’ll see over the coming months.
- We know that sometimes life isn’t straight-forward, so we always use a common-sense approach to our underwriting. This means that we’ll always try to find a way to lend where it makes sense.
- We’re also dedicated to supporting you to develop your business. Our Growth Series content hub gives free access to blogs, podcasts and practical guides to help you get information on topics such as recruitment and marketing as well as providing valuable insight from key players in the industry.

## Modern Slavery Act Transparency Statement | Accord Mortgages


# 2025 Modern Slavery Statement


## This statement follows Section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the Act). It explains the steps that Yorkshire Building Society (YBS) take to prevent Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking in our business and supply chains.


### About Yorkshire Building Society

YBS is based in the UK, with our main office in Bradford. We are regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA).
YBS trades under the brands Yorkshire Building Society, Chelsea Building Society, Norwich & Peterborough Building Society, and through our wholly owned intermediary lending subsidiary; Accord Mortgages Ltd (Accord). YBS also includes YBS Covered Bonds LLP (YBS being one of the members).
YBS is governed by a Board of Directors, responsible for the overall direction and ensuring long term success. The Board includes a mix of Executive and Non-Executive Directors and is supported by various committees. These committees oversee specific areas of management and regulatory adherence.
YBS mainly provides mortgages and savings accounts direct through our branches, customer contact centres and online channels. We also offer YBS savings through agencies and Accord products through mortgage brokers. Additionally, we provide referrals for insurances through third-party relationships, subject to UK regulation, and provide mortgage finance to businesses.

## Managing the Risk of Modern Slavery


### Purchase of Goods, Services and Resources

YBS purchase most goods and services from UK companies but do have a small number of international suppliers. We have a Supply Chain team that works with an outsourced Procurement Team to support Supplier Relationship Management specialists from different areas of YBS.
When using services (including human resources) outside of the UK, we may employ colleagues both in the UK and in other countries. Where applicable, we have contracts in place for everyone working for YBS and for suppliers based outside of the UK. This ensures that YBS remains compliant with regulatory requirements and our own business standards.
Our Supply Chain processes include:
- Due Diligence checks: We carefully check our suppliers before signing a contract.
- Ongoing Risk Monitoring: We regularly check our suppliers’ risk profiles to ensure they remain unchanged throughout the contract lifecycle.
We continually review and improve these processes through engaging our suppliers, raising awareness of issues and requirements, and training key colleagues who manage supplier relationships.
We have published a set of Minimum Standards for Suppliers , which outlines our position and expectations of all suppliers in regard to Modern Slavery. This document is referenced in all competitive supplier processes.

### Our Customers and our Colleagues

As a mutual organisation, YBS is owned by and accountable to its members (around 3 million members).
Our purpose is to provide Real Help with Real Life for our customers by focusing on four central priorities:
- Providing a Place to Call Home
- Improving Financial Wellbeing
- Investing in Our People
- Build a Greener Society
We have around 3,500 colleagues. Additionally, when appropriate, we hire temporary colleagues, or suppliers to deliver additional tasks. All colleagues are employed by YBS and are carefully checked before they start work. Every colleague earns at least the Real Living Wage and are eligible to join an independent union.

### Risk Assessment and Due Diligence

Operating in a highly regulated sector, we are committed to maintaining high ethical standards and ensuring our business and supply chain are free from Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking.
As part of our controls, we maintain robust checks, and conduct regular business wide Financial Crime Risk Assessments (this is relevant because Modern Slavery is a crime where the proceeds and benefits can be laundered through financial products & services) to evaluate risk exposure and control effectiveness. These assessments help establish residual level of financial crime risk, including exposure to Modern Slavery.
We actively seek to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of checks and risk assessments. We ensure these reflect industry standards, legislative and regulatory requirements. We consider external events and emerging risks and re-perform risk assessments where required.
We encourage all colleagues, including temporary colleagues, and suppliers to report any suspicions of Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking through our clear and confidential reporting processes. This ensures that any concerns or incidents can be promptly addressed and thoroughly investigated.

### Our Policies in relation to Modern Slavery

The following business-wide policies include appropriate reference to or consideration of the risk of Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking. These policies include:
- Modern Slavery Policy
- Financial Crime Policy
- Procurement and Third Party Risk Policy
- Whistleblowing Policy
- Employee Code of Conduct
- Supplier Procurement Code of Conduct and Minimum Standards for Suppliers
- Recruitment Policy Guide
Our procedures are designed to ensure that we are meeting the expectations of our regulators, customers, employees and suppliers and that they are at the heart of our business decisions.
We use various controls to protect our members’ money and personal information and safeguard our systems and services. This ensures they are not used to perpetrate or facilitate crime, including Modern Slavery offences. In addition, colleagues must remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity that may be linked to Modern Slavery or Human Trafficking.

### Training on Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking

We have mandatory training for all colleagues, with a section focused on Modern Slavery and how to identify and report red flags. In addition, all colleagues receive regular training to understand and follow our values and policies. This ongoing education reinforces our commitment to preventing Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking within our business and supply chain.

### Our 2024 Pledges

In 2024, we established and successfully delivered five pledges to continue improving our Modern Slavery initiatives.
Pledge 1 - Refine and enhance the mandatory Modern Slavery module (AML), and pro-actively promote drop-in sessions to all high-risk areas to continue Policy adherence. Enhancements to the Modern Slavery training and four drop-in sessions completed.
Pledge 2 - Actively assess Modern Slavery process adherence within the Supply Chain & other Contractual Relationships which sit outside of the Third-Party Risk Framework. New and existing suppliers now follow the risk triage assessment process.
Pledge 3 - Drive communications to uplift colleagues’ knowledge and awareness of Modern Slavery Policy and their responsibilities. Throughout the year, seven targeted surveys identified knowledge gaps, guiding the focus of our drop-in sessions.
Pledge 4 - Review the Society’s Policies and Processes in higher risk areas to ensure Modern Slavery Policies are considered and referenced. All Tier One Policies have been reviewed, and any necessary references have been added or scheduled for inclusion in next review.
Pledge 5 - Ensure the Society’s approach to Modern Slavery remains in line with the Society’s strategic direction and the external environment. Enhance this by using insight from external sources. Modern Slavery Policy updated 2024 taking into consideration our strategy and changes in the external environment as identified in our Regulatory Scanning.

### Our 2025 Pledges

In 2025, our five pledges continue the themes of previous years, focussing on maintaining our position and controls to identify and prevent instances of Modern Slavery.
Pledge 1 – We will monitor adherence to our Modern Slavery Policy across our business, and ensure we maintain the levels of training and awareness that underpin the Policy.
Pledge 2 – We will maintain the controls which assess current and potential suppliers against the risk of Modern Slavery.
Pledge 3 – We will continuously review key Tier 1 YBS policies to ensure controls are effective in preventing Modern Slavery.
Pledge 4 – We will monitor changes in the external environment, including emerging risks, new legislation, and best practices, to ensure our approach remains relevant and proactive.
Pledge 5 – We will ensure our strategic objectives and investment aligns with our commitment to preventing Modern Slavery and promotes ethical practices.
This statement was approved by the Boards of YBS and Accord in March 2025 respectively and is signed on behalf of those Boards by:
Name: Tom Ranger (Chief Financial Officer and Executive Director).
This statement covers the period of the financial year January 2024 to December 2024. This statement was correct at the time of publication on 28 March 2025. Changes in circumstances since may affect its accuracy.

## Consent

Cookies are needed to allow you to get the full experience from our website and services. Before we put cookies on your device we need your consent. When you visit our website, you will see a banner telling you that our website uses cookies. This will stay in place until you either accept cookies or manage your preferences.

### 4. Targeting cookies

Targeting cookies are usually placed by third parties such as advertising networks with the website operator’s permission, so they are usually linked to site functionality provided by the third party organisation.

### We use targeting cookies to:

- Identify how effective our advertising is and provide you with information in the future that we believe is relevant to you
We work closely with some third party companies who provide services such as customer feedback, advertising, and social networking. In these cases, the third party organisation may set their own cookies which are controlled by them and covered by their own policies:
Please note YBS is not responsible for the content of external websites.
You can turn off targeting cookies only by blocking specific companies if you’d prefer. You will still receive advertising on the internet, but the ads you see may not be as relevant to you and your interests.

## What is the difference between a first or third party cookie?

A first party cookie is set by the website you are visiting. For example, cookies on the Chelsea Building Society are set by the  Chelsea Building Society. Some of our services are reliant upon cookies set by other websites which are known as third party cookies, and the domain setting a cookie may appear as 'www.another-website.com'.

## How long will cookies stay on my device?


## Further information about cookies

- Some browsers include a feature known as ‘Do Not Track’ or DNT. This allows you to indicate a preference that websites should not track you. However, whilst DNT is available in many browsers, websites are not required to recognise its request, so it may not always work.

## Further information about cookies

- Google has developed a browser add-on to allow users to opt-out of Google Analytics across all websites which use it. This is also available in the Chrome web store .
- Some browsers include a feature known as ‘Do Not Track’ or DNT. This allows you to indicate a preference that websites should not track you. However, whilst DNT is available in many browsers, websites are not required to recognise its request, so it may not always work. You can get help on how to use DNT in Microsoft Edge , Internet Explorer , Firefox , Chrome , Safari and Opera .
- Internet Explorer has a feature called Tracking Protection Lists which allows you to import a list of websites you want to block.
For more information on how private browsing works, as well as its limitations, visit the support pages for your browser: Microsoft Edge , Internet Explorer , Firefox , Chrome , Safari ( mobile and desktop ) and Opera .

## How can I opt out of targeted advertising?

If you prefer not to receive targeted advertising, you can choose to opt out by registering your decision to opt out with advertising companies. The European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance website Your Online Choices allows you to install opt-out cookies.
