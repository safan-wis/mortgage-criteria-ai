ADDITIONAL BORROWING  BUY TO LET
--------------------------------
  Existing Buy to Let mortgage customers must always be treated as a new lending proposition. They are assessed and under written on the basis of the aggregate borrowing/overall exposure. The applicant must always complete the appropriate application and detail the purpose of the borrowing.

  For further information, details of products and fees payable please contact our Intermediary Mortgage Experts Centre on 0345 073 3330 - Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm.

  UL LIST:

    • The term of the further advance must be less than or equal to the term outstanding on the main mortgage account (maximum term is 35 years (Interest only) or 25 years (Repayment or Part and Part) from origination of main mortgage)
    • All existing group mortgage accounts (both Buy to Let and Residential) must be up to date and well conducted.
    • For Joint Mortgages applications  Where any additional borrowing is in excess of £50,000 and is to be wholly for the benefit of only one party to the mortgage e.g. purchase of second Buy to Let property to be registered in the name of one party, before any funds are released Independent Legal Advice must be obtained by all other borrower/borrowers not directly benefiting.



ADVERSE CREDIT HISTORY  BUY TO LET
----------------------------------
  County Court Judgements (CCJs/defaults)

  Adverse credit as detailed below must be declined:

  *Includes partially settled defaults which will be referred out to check whether full and final settlement has been made. Applications can be considered where the above is identified but only where documentary evidence of a settled dispute has been provided by the customer.

  Bankruptcy/Debt Relief Orders/IVAs

  Lending to a customer with a history of bankruptcy or who has been the subject of a Debt Relief Order (DRO) or an Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA) can be considered, provided any bankruptcy, DRO or IVA was registered more than 6 years prior to the date of submission of any mortgage application and no longer shows on the credit reference bureau information.

  It is not acceptable to lend if we are aware that any applicant is currently bankrupt or subject to a DRO or IVA.

  Payment arrears/missed payments

  Any adverse credit identified, as detailed below, must be declined

  Payment arrangements:

  If payment arrangements are identified in the credit search that are still running or have ended less than 1 year prior to the time of application, the case must be declined.

  Mortgage or rent arrears

  If arrears of more than one month have occurred in the past 6 months or 3 months arrears have occurred in the past 2 years, the case is outside lending policy and is to be declined. However, this decision could be changed if there is an acceptable technical reason, or if evidence of a settled dispute is provided and verified by the lender.

  If this is the case, please contact our Intermediary Mortgage Experts on 0345 073 3330 - Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm.

  Any applicant who is known to have had any mortgaged property repossessed should normally be declined. However, where historic, underwriters can consider such mortgage requests, provided clear rationale is provided to support any lending decision.

  Bankruptcy/IVA

  It is not acceptable to lend where any applicant is currently bankrupt or subject to a Debt Relief Order (DRO) and/or Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA) however, lending can be considered provided any bankruptcy, DRO or IVA was registered more than 6 years ago from the date of submission (and hence no longer appears on the credit reference bureau information).

AFFORDABILITY  BUY TO LET
-------------------------
  Barclays uses 1 of 2 methods to calculate affordability. Applications for customers that meet the following criteria will initially be assessed on an Interest Coverage Ratio (ICR)

  Basic Rate Taxpayers  125% Higher/Additional Rate Taxpayers  160%

  The income tax band selected should take into account gross rental income for all properties that the applicant will own on completion.

  For Limited Company Directors please use their highest tax band payable to ensure all income is included. For more information on income tax bands please visit https://www.gov.uk/income-tax-rates

  If the application does not meet ICR eligibility, applicants are required to pass a full personal solvency and affordability test which includes earned and rental income, income tax liability (including BTL mortgage interest relief), credit commitments including residential mortgage payment, existing and applied for BTL mortgage payment, other costs associated with the rental property, essential expenditure and living costs. In all instances, you should check client affordability prior to submitting a case by completing the BTL affordability calculator.

  Full details must be input in MAX including all outstanding residential and/or other Buy to Let mortgages. A maximum of 4 applicants will be assessed if an affordability assessment is required, although we only consider the 2 highest incomes.

  NOTE: For further advance borrowing, the affordability rate current at the time of assessment must be applied to the total borrowing after accounting for any increase in lending.

  BTL applications in a sole name, which fail solvency, can be considered where a joint residential mortgage  with no evidence of arrears history  is held by Barclays.

  UL LIST:
    • currently own or part own a UK residential owner occupied property
    • require a loan amount <=£1m
    • not be considered a portfolio landlord (hold 4 or more BTL mortgages upon completion)
    • rental income from background properties must cover the mortgage payments at 100%
    • The cover required will be dependent on the customers income tax band. The gross rental income, confirmed by the valuer, must cover a stressed monthly mortgage interest payment by at least 



AGE/TERM
--------
  Where the term goes into retirement, or the applicant is retired on submission of the BTL application, it is acceptable under standard BTL lending policy providing the following criteria is satisfied:

  UL LIST:
    • Minimum age of any applicant 18 years
    • The mortgage term must not extend beyond age 80 of any applicant

  UL LIST:
    • Principal applicant meets minimum income requirements

The maximum number of mortgaged BTL/PTL properties held must not exceed 6 with Barclays and must not exceed 10 across all lenders (including Barclays). This includes the subject (applied for) property.

  Landlords with 4 mortgaged rental properties or more, across all lenders, are classed as portfolio landlords. This includes the subject (applied for) property.



ALLOWABLE GROSS INCOME
----------------------
  Your applicant must have a minimum gross annual income of £25,000. For joint applications, at least one applicant must earn £25,000. For individual loans above £1m a minimum gross annual personal/earned income of £75,000 per annum is required (for joint applications, the two primary applicants must earn £100,000 where neither applicant earns £75,000).

BONUS, OVERTIME OR COMMISSION (BTL)
-----------------------------------
  Documentation Monthly Bonus - 3 latest payslips which evidence monthly bonus amounts they have received ( Bonus must appear on 3 out of 3 monthly payslips and at least 1out of 5 weekly payslips or 3 out of 13 weekly payslips) Monthly Overtime or Commission -3 latest payslips which evidence at least 1 amount P60 will be needed where more than 50% of the most recent 3 monthly average is needed to meet affordability. Monthly Bonus Identify if monthly* bonus is on the most recent 3 months* payslips Well never use less than 50% of the most recent 3 months average Average the total monthly bonus amounts from the last 3 months* payslips and use the same payslips to compare the annualised figure against the P60 Youll need to deduct the salary, allowances and any bonus payments that are less frequent than monthly (or more) when reviewing a P60 and calculating the monthly bonus The remaining figure should then be divided by 12 to show the monthly average from the P60 Take the lower of the following 2 figures (unless the minimum 50% applies) 100% of the 3 months average 100% of the latest P60 monthly average *If frequency of pay is not monthly (e.g. bi weekly / 4 weekly / weekly), Please see weekly, 2-weekly or 4-weekly section below. Annual Bonus Youll need to use the gross (pre-tax) bonus figure when calculating your customers bonuses. Bonuses paid less frequently than monthly are classed as annual Bonuses paid monthly or more frequently are classed as monthly* * See Monthly Bonus section for further details Note - Your customer is not required to have been with the same employer for 2 years, however, the most recent annual bonus must have been paid by their current employer and, in all cases, must have been paid within the last 12 months. An annual bonus can be considered where it has only been paid in the most recent year. Payslips The number of payslips required is dependent on the frequency of the bonus. We need evidence of their annual bonus over the last 2 years. If your customer receives their bonus Quarterly then we need 8 payslips which evidence the bonus payment If your customer receives their bonus Half Yearly then we need 4 payslips which evidence the bonus payment If your customer receives their bonus Annually then we need 2 payslips which evidence the bonus payment Note - You can use the payslips to show annual bonuses over the last 2 years (We dont need P60s to validate, and we require no additional calculations). P60s Where your customer cant provide the required payslips, we need to confirm the annual bonus is sustainable using the last 2 years P60s. P60s are only acceptable where the customer is not also in receipt of regular bonus, overtime or commission. Obtain the P60s to confirm bonus over the last 2 years. Calculate the annual bonus figure for both years If the latest years bonus figure is lower than the previous years, you can only use the latest years figure. If it is higher than the previous years you can use an average of the two years Calculate Overtime or commission Identify if monthly* overtime/commission is showing on at least 1 of the most recent 3 months* payslips Average the total monthly* overtime/commission amounts from the last 3 months* payslips and use the same payslips to compare the annualised figure against the P60 Youll need to deduct the salary, allowances and any bonus payments that are less frequent than monthly (or more) when reviewing a P60 and calculating the monthly overtime/commission The remaining figure should then be divided by 12 to show the monthly average from the P60 Take the lower of the following 2 figures (unless the minimum 50% applies) 100% of the 3 months average 100% of the latest P60 monthly average **If frequency of pay is not monthly (e.g. bi weekly / 4 weekly / weekly), see weekly, 2-weekly or 4-weekly section below Examples Example 1 (evidenced on 3 consecutive most recent payslips) Basic = £20,000 - Monthly bonus (average over last 3 months) = £1,000 - P60 Total income = £23,000 Bonus amount (P60 value) = £3,000 (divided by 12 = £250 per month) Monthly bonus Figure to use = £500 per month Decision - As the P60 monthly average value after basic salary is deducted is less than 50% of the latest 3 payslips, the figure added to application is £500 per month (50% current average monthly bonus = £1,000 x 50%) Example 2 (evidenced on at least 1 out of 3 recent payslips) Basic annual income = £20,000 - Monthly overtime (average over last 3 months) = £1,000 per month - P60 Total annual income = £29,000 Less Basic annual income = £20,000 Overtime amount (P60 average value) = £9,000 (divided by 12 = £750 per month) Overtime Figure to use = £750 per month Decision - As the P60 monthly average value after basic salary is deducted is lower than 100% of the average of the latest 3 payslips, the figure added to MAX is £750 per month (use the lower of the 2 averages) Example 3 (evidenced on at least 1 out of 3 recent payslips) Basic annual income = £20,000 - Commission (average over last 3 months) = £1,000 per month - P60 Total annual income = £38,000 Less Basic annual income = £20,000 Commission amount (P60 average value) = £18,000 (divided by 12 = £1,500 per month) Commission Figure to use = £1,000 Decision - As the P60 monthly average value after basic salary is deducted is higher than 100% of average of the latest 3 payslips, the figure added to MAX is £1,000 per month (use the lower of the 2 averages) If income Then* Monthly Use latest months payslip figure 4-weekly Use latest months payslip figure Multiply this figure by 13 (for annual figure) Divide annual figure by 12 2-weekly Total figures from last 3 payslips Divide this by 6 (for averaged weekly pay) Multiply this by 52 (for annual figure) Divide this by 12 (for equivalent monthly figure) Weekly Total the figures from last 5 payslips Divide this figure by 5 (for averaged weekly figure) Multiply the average weekly figure by 52 (for annual figure) Divide annual figure by 12



BUSINESS RELATED LENDING
------------------------
  Applications from your client to purchase properties in their own personal name from a Limited Company where they have a financial controlling interest are outside our standard lending criteria.



CLADDING/ THE BUILDING SAFETY ACT 2022  BUY TO LET
--------------------------------------------------
  UL LIST:
    • The Building Safety Act 2022 provides protection from the remediation costs of replacing external combustible material where there is an agreed approach to remediation in place.
    • Buildings that have external wall systems may require an EWS1 rating. Where a rating is A3 OR B2 this indicates some form of remediation is required.
    • There are a variety of options available to leaseholders and Barclays made a commitment to help customers living in or buying impacted properties where there is a qualifying lease or planned remediation in place by a recognised body.
    • To support applications for impacted properties that require remediation we will need one of the following to be provided to us with your clients mortgage application.
    • Written confirmation of intention to complete the works from a developer who has signed a contact with the government. You can see a full list of developers who have signed the pledge on .GOV.UK
    • A Building Safety Act 2022 Government Leaseholder Deed of Certificate Form accompanied by a Building Safety Act 2022 Landlords Certificate
    • Written confirmation from a housing association confirming they are completing the remediation or written confirmation from DLUHC confirming the property is approved for funding to remediate. For letters from DLUHC, these should clearly state if any financial liability is passed to the leaseholder or be accompanied by a leaseholder or landlord certificate.
    • Where your client provides the Landlord and Leaseholder certificates it is important to capture the financial commitment they will have. You can find the total sum payable on the landlord certificate within the work undertaken on relevant defects section.
    • Any amount the client must pay will be taken over a 10-year period. Therefore, the amount due on Monday 14th February 2022, should be divided by 120 months and captured as or within the service charge to ensure affordability is met.
    • Developer or Housing Association remediated properties will have no financial liability passed to the leaseholder and therefore will not impact affordability.
    • Please note: if the application is for a property that requires fire safety remediation we will only proceed where we have satisfactory evidence in the format/s detailed above. In the event this cannot be provided we would be unable to support your customers mortgage application at this time.
    • For customers who already hold their mortgage with Barclays against a property that requires remediation we can support rate switch applications, permission to let requests and conversion from BTL to residential or vice versa without evidence being required. Where any additional borrowing is required for existing customers, the rules detailed would apply.



COMMITMENTS  BUY TO LET
-----------------------
  Applications for customers that meet the following criteria will initially be assessed on an Interest Coverage Ratio (ICR)

    • Regular Pension Payments  including any additional voluntary payments (eg AVCs) being paid regularly from income. One-off contributions, for example from an annual bonus, can be disregarded.

CONTRACT WORKERS  BUY TO LET
----------------------------
  Our policy on applicants who are contractors depends on if they are working on an employed or self-employed basis.

  Applicants employed in professional roles where contracts are provided on a fixed term basis, but each contract rolls to the next placement and so the overarching employment does not change (i.e. Junior Doctors, Teachers, Junior Solicitors), should be keyed as employed. These roles will all receive a salary.

  All contractors

  Umbrella, Agency or Fixed Term contractors

  The following policy applies to contract workers who are employed on a PAYE basis (e.g. via an umbrella company or agency): Income is calculated on an employed basis using 3 months (or equivalent) pay slips, and taking an average where necessary, any holiday pay received is included within the average. Where the customer has any form of variable pay or bonus this should be calculated using employed policy.

  Applications for contractors in occupations such as professional sport will be assessed on a case-by-case basis to check for sustainability and plausibility. By recording these types of customer on the application as Employed - Fixed Term Contract this will ensure these checks can take place.

  Self-employed contractors

  For contract workers operating on a self-employed basis affordability calculations will depend on how their business is structured. Where ALL of the following additional requirements are met a daily rate calculation may be applied

  Daily-rate calculation

  To calculate gross income, you will

  If the contract expresses pay as an hourly-rate, then the applicants income should be calculated on the assumption there are a maximum of 40 working hours per week, unless the contract or the applicant specifies a lower number of hours. The resulting weekly amount should then be multiplied by 46 working weeks to arrive at the gross annual income for affordability purposes.

  Additional commitments (where daily-rate is used) - When the daily-rate calculation is being used; credit commitments for which the limited company is liable/responsible (e.g. business loans, including bounce back loans) should be recorded within the application and considered as part of the overall affordability assessment. On the application, the monthly payment should be entered as shown on the business bank statements, the outstanding balance detailed as £1 and the remaining term as 1y 0m.

  The following additional documents are required if the daily-rate calculation is being applied

  All contractors using the daily rate should be recorded on the application as Employed - Fixed Term Contract.

  Contractors not employed via an umbrella or agency or that do not meet the daily rate criteria must document income following our self-employed policy. Please refer to our self-employed and allowable income sections for further details.

TERM OF MORTGAGE - BUY TO LET
-----------------------------
  The term of a Buy To Let Interest-only mortgage can be from 5 to 35 years and for a Buy To Let Repayment mortgage the term can be from 5 to 25 years.



VALUATIONS - BUY TO LET
-----------------------
  To be able to lend on a property, Barclays requires a valuation to be carried out. When you apply for a Barclays mortgage, the valuation type depends on whether your mortgage will be on a residential or Buy to Let basis.

  The mortgage valuation is our standard report for all residential applications and includes a description of the property, an opinion of the market value of the property as at the date of inspection, and an estimate of the current cost to reinstate the property in its present form (where appropriate).

  Its important to remember that the mortgage valuation is a report which is primarily for Barclays purposes and confirms whether the property is suitable security for a mortgage  it is not a survey. As such, we ask that all clients consider instructing a separate survey to provide them with a more detailed assessment of the condition of the property.

  Your client may wish to contact Countrywide Surveying Services on 0800 012 6995 *, e.surv on 0800 169 9661 *, or any other provider to discuss the different survey options available. More information on the types of survey available can be seen found on the Home Surveys section of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors website.

  Please note that if your clients do instruct their own survey, this will be a separate contract between them and their chosen survey provider with separate fees applying. Barclays will always rely on the mortgage valuation for the purpose of agreeing the mortgage.

  Automated valuation model (AVM)

  For Buy to Let remortgages and further advances on properties up to £1m in value (up to £2m in London and South East), where the loan to value required is 65% (subject to product availability) or less, we use AVMs to assist with instant mortgage decisions. Whether you apply through MAX or via other online systems*, the use of AVMs will help speed up the decision and offer a better process for your customer.

  AVMs are only suitable for further borrowing where the latest valuation was a physical one  i.e. not an AVM.

  * For example, via MTE or Trigold.

  Japanese knotweed

  Japanese Knotweed is an invasive plant introduced into the UK and has no natural predators. The plant is known to exploit existing weaknesses in buildings. Applications where Japanese Knotweed is identified should be looked at in accordance with the following requirements:

The guarantee must be for a minimum of 10 years, be property specific and transferable to subsequent owners and any Mortgagee in Possession.

  An insurance backed treatment plan must be confirmed prior to completion. It is not necessary for the recommended remedial works to be completed prior to the release of any mortgage monies.

  Valuation and rental assessment appeal

  Customers can appeal against Valuations where the following apply

  For remortgage and further advance cases, where there is more than a 25% variance between the customers estimated value and the actual valuation provided by the Banks nominated valuer.

  For purchase cases, where there is a variance of more than 10% between the purchase price and the valuation.

  This applies to both Residential and Buy to Let cases.

UL LIST:
  • A-C A-C Additional borrowing  Buy to Let Additional borrowing  Buy to Let Existing Buy to Let mortgage customers must always be treated as a new lending proposition. They are assessed and under written on the basis of the aggregate borrowing/overall exposure. The applicant must always complete the appropriate application and detail the purpose of the borrowing. The main account must be running for a minimum of 6 months before a further advance will be considered and a minimum of 6 months since last advance date. The term of the further advance must be less than or equal to the term outstanding on the main mortgage account (maximum term is 35 years (Interest only) or 25 years (Repayment or Part and Part) from origination of main mortgage) All existing group mortgage accounts (both Buy to Let and Residential) must be up to date and well conducted. For Joint Mortgages applications  Where any additional borrowing is in excess of £50,000 and is to be wholly for the benefit of only one party to the mortgage e.g. purchase of second Buy to Let property to be registered in the name of one party, before any funds are released Independent Legal Advice must be obtained by all other borrower/borrowers not directly benefiting.

Applications can be considered where the above is identified but only where documentary evidence of a settled dispute has been provided by the customer. Bankruptcy/Debt Relief Orders/IVAs Lending to a customer with a history of bankruptcy or who has been the subject of a Debt Relief Order (DRO) or an Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA) can be considered, provided any bankruptcy, DRO or IVA was registered more than 6 years prior to the date of submission of any mortgage application and no longer shows on the credit reference bureau information. It is not acceptable to lend if we are aware that any applicant is currently bankrupt or subject to a DRO or IVA. Payment arrears/missed payments Any adverse credit identified, as detailed below, must be declined Arrears of 2 or more months on any one account in the past 6 months Payment arrangements: If payment arrangements are identified in the credit search that are still running or have ended less than 1 year prior to the time of application, the case must be declined. Mortgage or rent arrears If arrears of more than one month have occurred in the past 6 months or 3 months arrears have occurred in the past 2 years, the case is outside lending policy and is to be declined. However, this decision could be changed if there is an acceptable technical reason, or if evidence of a settled dispute is provided and verified by the lender. If this is the case, please contact our Intermediary Mortgage Experts on 0345 073 3330 - Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm. Any applicant who is known to have had any mortgaged property repossessed should normally be declined. However, where historic, underwriters can consider such mortgage requests, provided clear rationale is provided to support any lending decision. Bankruptcy/IVA It is not acceptable to lend where any applicant is currently bankrupt or subject to a Debt Relief Order (DRO) and/or Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA) however, lending can be considered provided any bankruptcy, DRO or IVA was registered more than 6 years ago from the date of submission (and hence no longer appears on the credit reference bureau information).

Kensington offer more flexible lending criteria to help people who may not meet typical lending requirements. Learn more. Affordability  Buy to Let Affordability  Buy to Let Barclays uses 1 of 2 methods to calculate affordability. Applications for customers that meet the following criteria will initially be assessed on an Interest Coverage Ratio (ICR) currently own or part own a UK residential owner occupied property require a loan amount <=£1m not be considered a portfolio landlord (hold 4 or more BTL mortgages upon completion) rental income from background properties must cover the mortgage payments at 100% The cover required will be dependent on the customers income tax band. The gross rental income, confirmed by the valuer, must cover a stressed monthly mortgage interest payment by at least  Basic Rate Taxpayers  125% Higher/Additional Rate Taxpayers  160% The income tax band selected should take into account gross rental income for all properties that the applicant will own on completion. For Limited Company Directors please use their highest tax band payable to ensure all income is included. For more information on income tax bands please visit https://www.gov.uk/income-tax-rates If the application does not meet ICR eligibility, applicants are required to pass a full personal solvency and affordability test which includes earned and rental income, income tax liability (including BTL mortgage interest relief), credit commitments including residential mortgage payment, existing and applied for BTL mortgage payment, other costs associated with the rental property, essential expenditure and living costs. In all instances, you should check client affordability prior to submitting a case by completing the BTL affordability calculator. Full details must be input in MAX including all outstanding residential and/or other Buy to Let mortgages. A maximum of 4 applicants will be assessed if an affordability assessment is required, although we only consider the 2 highest incomes. NOTE: For further advance borrowing, the affordability rate current at the time of assessment must be applied to the total borrowing after accounting for any increase in lending. BTL applications in a sole name, which fail solvency, can be considered where a joint residential mortgage  with no evidence of arrears history  is held by Barclays. Age/Term Age/Term Minimum age of any applicant 18 years The mortgage term must not extend beyond age 80 of any applicant Where the term goes into retirement, or the applicant is retired on submission of the BTL application, it is acceptable under standard BTL lending policy providing the following criteria is satisfied: Principal applicant meets minimum income requirements Principal applicant is in receipt of income from an acceptable source as defined in the Allowable Gross Income section Mortgage term does not extend beyond age 80 of any applicant Maximum term is 35 years (Interest only) or 25 years (Repayment or Part and Part) from origination of main mortgage. Aggregate borrowing/overall exposure Aggregate borrowing/overall exposure Maximum aggregate borrowing across all Barclays BTLs is £3m. Maximum aggregate Buy to Let borrowing with Barclays AND other lenders must not exceed £4.5M in total.

Monthly Bonus Identify if monthly* bonus is on the most recent 3 months* payslips Well never use less than 50% of the most recent 3 months average Average the total monthly bonus amounts from the last 3 months* payslips and use the same payslips to compare the annualised figure against the P60 Youll need to deduct the salary, allowances and any bonus payments that are less frequent than monthly (or more) when reviewing a P60 and calculating the monthly bonus The remaining figure should then be divided by 12 to show the monthly average from the P60 Take the lower of the following 2 figures (unless the minimum 50% applies) 100% of the 3 months average 100% of the latest P60 monthly average *If frequency of pay is not monthly (e.g. bi weekly / 4 weekly / weekly), Please see weekly, 2-weekly or 4-weekly section below. Annual Bonus Youll need to use the gross (pre-tax) bonus figure when calculating your customers bonuses. Bonuses paid less frequently than monthly are classed as annual Bonuses paid monthly or more frequently are classed as monthly* * See Monthly Bonus section for further details Note - Your customer is not required to have been with the same employer for 2 years, however, the most recent annual bonus must have been paid by their current employer and, in all cases, must have been paid within the last 12 months. An annual bonus can be considered where it has only been paid in the most recent year. Payslips The number of payslips required is dependent on the frequency of the bonus. We need evidence of their annual bonus over the last 2 years. If your customer receives their bonus Quarterly then we need 8 payslips which evidence the bonus payment If your customer receives their bonus Half Yearly then we need 4 payslips which evidence the bonus payment If your customer receives their bonus Annually then we need 2 payslips which evidence the bonus payment Note - You can use the payslips to show annual bonuses over the last 2 years (We dont need P60s to validate, and we require no additional calculations). P60s Where your customer cant provide the required payslips, we need to confirm the annual bonus is sustainable using the last 2 years P60s. P60s are only acceptable where the customer is not also in receipt of regular bonus, overtime or commission. Obtain the P60s to confirm bonus over the last 2 years. Calculate the annual bonus figure for both years If the latest years bonus figure is lower than the previous years, you can only use the latest years figure. If it is higher than the previous years you can use an average of the two years Calculate Overtime or commission Identify if monthly* overtime/commission is showing on at least 1 of the most recent 3 months* payslips Average the total monthly* overtime/commission amounts from the last 3 months* payslips and use the same payslips to compare the annualised figure against the P60 Youll need to deduct the salary, allowances and any bonus payments that are less frequent than monthly (or more) when reviewing a P60 and calculating the monthly overtime/commission The remaining figure should then be divided by 12 to show the monthly average from the P60 Take the lower of the following 2 figures (unless the minimum 50% applies) 100% of the 3 months average 100% of the latest P60 monthly average **If frequency of pay is not monthly (e.g. bi weekly / 4 weekly / weekly), see weekly, 2-weekly or 4-weekly section below Examples Example 1 (evidenced on 3 consecutive most recent payslips) Basic = £20,000 - Monthly bonus (average over last 3 months) = £1,000 - P60 Total income = £23,000 Bonus amount (P60 value) = £3,000 (divided by 12 = £250 per month) Monthly bonus Figure to use = £500 per month Decision - As the P60 monthly average value after basic salary is deducted is less than 50% of the latest 3 payslips, the figure added to application is £500 per month (50% current average monthly bonus = £1,000 x 50%) Example 2 (evidenced on at least 1 out of 3 recent payslips) Basic annual income = £20,000 - Monthly overtime (average over last 3 months) = £1,000 per month - P60 Total annual income = £29,000 Less Basic annual income = £20,000 Overtime amount (P60 average value) = £9,000 (divided by 12 = £750 per month) Overtime Figure to use = £750 per month Decision - As the P60 monthly average value after basic salary is deducted is lower than 100% of the average of the latest 3 payslips, the figure added to MAX is £750 per month (use the lower of the 2 averages) Example 3 (evidenced on at least 1 out of 3 recent payslips) Basic annual income = £20,000 - Commission (average over last 3 months) = £1,000 per month - P60 Total annual income = £38,000 Less Basic annual income = £20,000 Commission amount (P60 average value) = £18,000 (divided by 12 = £1,500 per month) Commission Figure to use = £1,000 Decision - As the P60 monthly average value after basic salary is deducted is higher than 100% of average of the latest 3 payslips, the figure added to MAX is £1,000 per month (use the lower of the 2 averages) If income Then* Monthly Use latest months payslip figure 4-weekly Use latest months payslip figure Multiply this figure by 13 (for annual figure) Divide annual figure by 12 2-weekly Total figures from last 3 payslips Divide this by 6 (for averaged weekly pay) Multiply this by 52 (for annual figure) Divide this by 12 (for equivalent monthly figure) Weekly Total the figures from last 5 payslips Divide this figure by 5 (for averaged weekly figure) Multiply the average weekly figure by 52 (for annual figure) Divide annual figure by 12 Business related lending Business related lending Applications from your client to purchase properties in their own personal name from a Limited Company where they have a financial controlling interest are outside our standard lending criteria. Cladding/ The Building Safety Act 2022  Buy to Let Cladding/ The Building Safety Act 2022  Buy to Let The Building Safety Act 2022 provides protection from the remediation costs of replacing external combustible material where there is an agreed approach to remediation in place. Buildings that have external wall systems may require an EWS1 rating. Where a rating is A3 OR B2 this indicates some form of remediation is required. There are a variety of options available to leaseholders and Barclays made a commitment to help customers living in or buying impacted properties where there is a qualifying lease or planned remediation in place by a recognised body. To support applications for impacted properties that require remediation we will need one of the following to be provided to us with your clients mortgage application. Written confirmation of intention to complete the works from a developer who has signed a contact with the government. You can see a full list of developers who have signed the pledge on .GOV.UK A Building Safety Act 2022 Government Leaseholder Deed of Certificate Form accompanied by a Building Safety Act 2022 Landlords Certificate Written confirmation from a housing association confirming they are completing the remediation or written confirmation from DLUHC confirming the property is approved for funding to remediate. For letters from DLUHC, these should clearly state if any financial liability is passed to the leaseholder or be accompanied by a leaseholder or landlord certificate. Where your client provides the Landlord and Leaseholder certificates it is important to capture the financial commitment they will have. You can find the total sum payable on the landlord certificate within the work undertaken on relevant defects section. Any amount the client must pay will be taken over a 10-year period. Therefore, the amount due on Monday 14th February 2022, should be divided by 120 months and captured as or within the service charge to ensure affordability is met. Developer or Housing Association remediated properties will have no financial liability passed to the leaseholder and therefore will not impact affordability. Please note: if the application is for a property that requires fire safety remediation we will only proceed where we have satisfactory evidence in the format/s detailed above. In the event this cannot be provided we would be unable to support your customers mortgage application at this time. For customers who already hold their mortgage with Barclays against a property that requires remediation we can support rate switch applications, permission to let requests and conversion from BTL to residential or vice versa without evidence being required. Where any additional borrowing is required for existing customers, the rules detailed would apply. Commitments  Buy to Let Commitments  Buy to Let Applications for customers that meet the following criteria will initially be assessed on an Interest Coverage Ratio (ICR) currently own or part own a UK residential owner occupied property require a loan amount <=£1m not be considered a portfolio landlord (hold 4 or more BTL mortgages upon completion) rental income from background properties must cover the mortgage payments at 100% The cover required will be dependent on the customers income tax band.

In all instances, you should check client affordability prior to submitting a case by completing the BTL affordability calculator. The following commitments must be considered. Hire Purchase Agreements including Mail Order Payments, Bank Loans, Finance Loans, Payday Loan Advances (full amount outstanding applies) or Second Charges. Any other or future commitments such as monthly fees/interest payments under a shared equity loan agreement and/or deferred credit payments. If a customer is a guarantor for any mortgage, property rental agreement, secured loan or any other loans then the monthly payment of such commitments is applied in the affordability assessment in line with these requirements. Regular Pension Payments  including any additional voluntary payments (eg AVCs) being paid regularly from income. One-off contributions, for example from an annual bonus, can be disregarded. (Note: pension contributions will be automatically calculated as part of the affordability assessment. They should not be input as part of the application process) Court Orders relating to maintenance payments or judgement debts. Child Support Agency (CSA) payments. School Fees and Child Care/Nursery costs. Current Monthly Student Loan payment. Liability for ground rent, service and maintenance charges under any leasehold, commonhold or other agreement  including any equity sharing agreements.

Shared Equity Loan. Other regular commitments (excluding living expenses, clothes, food, utilities) Foreign Credit Commitments - Where a mortgage applicant has any credit commitment denominated in a currency other than GBP, this will be converted to sterling using Barclays Foreign Note Rate including balance and regular payments. This will be completed on the day the initial decision is obtained (i.e DIP 1) Other Considerations: Any loan/fixed repayment debt with less than 6 months to run can be ignored, provided that the total balance of loans in this category does not exceed £1,000. The total amount outstanding against any payday loan advance must be deducted from the applicants net income when assessing affordability. Any commitment (existing residential mortgage borrowing) which is to be repaid from the new proposed mortgage advance can be ignored provided a specific offer condition is made to this effect. Contract workers  Buy to Let Contract workers  Buy to Let Our policy on applicants who are contractors depends on if they are working on an employed or self-employed basis. Applicants employed in professional roles where contracts are provided on a fixed term basis, but each contract rolls to the next placement and so the overarching employment does not change (i.e. Junior Doctors, Teachers, Junior Solicitors), should be keyed as employed. These roles will all receive a salary. All contractors There can be no more than a 6-week gap between contracts Evidence of 12 months contracts (a minimum of 2 contracts must be provided if latest contract covers <12 months) is required  the only exception is where the applicant has recently moved from employee to contractor and provides services to their previous employer: In this case, we require confirmation that the client employed the applicant for at least 3 years before they became a contractor along with a copy of the service contract showing terms of remuneration, duration of contract and conditions of cancellation or termination There must be 3 months remaining on their current contract or alternatively be able to provide evidence of the next one Umbrella, Agency or Fixed Term contractors The following policy applies to contract workers who are employed on a PAYE basis (e.g. via an umbrella company or agency): Income is calculated on an employed basis using 3 months (or equivalent) pay slips, and taking an average where necessary, any holiday pay received is included within the average. Where the customer has any form of variable pay or bonus this should be calculated using employed policy. Applications for contractors in occupations such as professional sport will be assessed on a case-by-case basis to check for sustainability and plausibility. By recording these types of customer on the application as Employed - Fixed Term Contract this will ensure these checks can take place. Self-employed contractors For contract workers operating on a self-employed basis affordability calculations will depend on how their business is structured. Where ALL of the following additional requirements are met a daily rate calculation may be applied The firm is a limited company The firm has only one contract in place The firm does not employ anyone (other than the applicant themselves) The applicant is 100% owner of the limited company (sole shareholder) The applicants current contract equates to at least £218 per day or £50,000 per year (gross) Mortgage Loan-to-Value is  85% Daily-rate calculation To calculate gross income, you will Identify the lower of the following  Average Daily Rate of Pay (excl. VAT) from the 2 most recent contracts OR the most recent Daily Rate of Pay (excl. VAT) OR the actual income shown on the bank statements; then multiple by 5 and; then multiple by 46 to give the annual figure If the contract expresses pay as an hourly-rate, then the applicants income should be calculated on the assumption there are a maximum of 40 working hours per week, unless the contract or the applicant specifies a lower number of hours. The resulting weekly amount should then be multiplied by 46 working weeks to arrive at the gross annual income for affordability purposes. Additional commitments (where daily-rate is used) - When the daily-rate calculation is being used; credit commitments for which the limited company is liable/responsible (e.g. business loans, including bounce back loans) should be recorded within the application and considered as part of the overall affordability assessment. On the application, the monthly payment should be entered as shown on the business bank statements, the outstanding balance detailed as £1 and the remaining term as 1y 0m. The following additional documents are required if the daily-rate calculation is being applied Latest 3 full months consecutive personal bank statements confirming receipt of income Latest 3 full months consecutive business bank statements confirming receipt of income All contractors using the daily rate should be recorded on the application as Employed - Fixed Term Contract. Contractors not employed via an umbrella or agency or that do not meet the daily rate criteria must document income following our self-employed policy. Please refer to our self-employed and allowable income sections for further details. Credit reference searches Credit reference searches A full personal credit check will be undertaken on each applicant, director, shareholder, or member. In addition a company search will be carried out on all SPV Limited Companies and LLPs to confirm that they continue to meet our acceptable definition of a SPV Limited Company or LLP and that there have been no changes to the structure eg, change of directors/shareholders/members. If it is identified that a limited company, in which an applicant has greater than 15% shareholding, has any outstanding judgments totaling more than £5,000. Cryptoassets Cryptoassets You should make us aware if any portion of the customers income or source of wealth is cryptoasset-based or consists of investments in a crypto-related software business (e.g. Blockchain/DLT Tech firms). Cryptoassets can include cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin), utility tokens (unregulated cryptoassets usually issued as part of an ICO/ITO), asset tokens including stable coins (asset-backed coins with a value pegged to a physical asset of some kind) and security tokens. Applications of this nature will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis

Mortgage or rent arrears If arrears of more than one month have occurred in the past 6 months or 3 months arrears have occurred in the past 2 years, the case is outside lending policy and is to be declined. However, this decision could be changed if there is an acceptable technical reason, or if evidence of a settled dispute is provided and verified by the lender. If this is the case, please contact our Intermediary Mortgage Experts on 0345 073 3330 - Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm. Any applicant who is known to have had any mortgaged property repossessed should normally be declined. However, where historic, underwriters can consider such mortgage requests, provided clear rationale is provided to support any lending decision. Bankruptcy/IVA It is not acceptable to lend where any applicant is currently bankrupt or subject to a Debt Relief Order (DRO) and/or Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA) however, lending can be considered provided any bankruptcy, DRO or IVA was registered more than 6 years ago from the date of submission (and hence no longer appears on the credit reference bureau information).

  • Affordability  Buy to Let Affordability  Buy to Let Barclays uses 1 of 2 methods to calculate affordability. Applications for customers that meet the following criteria will initially be assessed on an Interest Coverage Ratio (ICR) currently own or part own a UK residential owner occupied property require a loan amount <=£1m not be considered a portfolio landlord (hold 4 or more BTL mortgages upon completion) rental income from background properties must cover the mortgage payments at 100% The cover required will be dependent on the customers income tax band. The gross rental income, confirmed by the valuer, must cover a stressed monthly mortgage interest payment by at least  Basic Rate Taxpayers  125% Higher/Additional Rate Taxpayers  160% The income tax band selected should take into account gross rental income for all properties that the applicant will own on completion. For Limited Company Directors please use their highest tax band payable to ensure all income is included. For more information on income tax bands please visit https://www.gov.uk/income-tax-rates If the application does not meet ICR eligibility, applicants are required to pass a full personal solvency and affordability test which includes earned and rental income, income tax liability (including BTL mortgage interest relief), credit commitments including residential mortgage payment, existing and applied for BTL mortgage payment, other costs associated with the rental property, essential expenditure and living costs. In all instances, you should check client affordability prior to submitting a case by completing the BTL affordability calculator. Full details must be input in MAX including all outstanding residential and/or other Buy to Let mortgages. A maximum of 4 applicants will be assessed if an affordability assessment is required, although we only consider the 2 highest incomes. NOTE: For further advance borrowing, the affordability rate current at the time of assessment must be applied to the total borrowing after accounting for any increase in lending. BTL applications in a sole name, which fail solvency, can be considered where a joint residential mortgage  with no evidence of arrears history  is held by Barclays.

Monthly Bonus Identify if monthly* bonus is on the most recent 3 months* payslips Well never use less than 50% of the most recent 3 months average Average the total monthly bonus amounts from the last 3 months* payslips and use the same payslips to compare the annualised figure against the P60 Youll need to deduct the salary, allowances and any bonus payments that are less frequent than monthly (or more) when reviewing a P60 and calculating the monthly bonus The remaining figure should then be divided by 12 to show the monthly average from the P60 Take the lower of the following 2 figures (unless the minimum 50% applies) 100% of the 3 months average 100% of the latest P60 monthly average *If frequency of pay is not monthly (e.g. bi weekly / 4 weekly / weekly), Please see weekly, 2-weekly or 4-weekly section below. Annual Bonus Youll need to use the gross (pre-tax) bonus figure when calculating your customers bonuses. Bonuses paid less frequently than monthly are classed as annual Bonuses paid monthly or more frequently are classed as monthly* * See Monthly Bonus section for further details Note - Your customer is not required to have been with the same employer for 2 years, however, the most recent annual bonus must have been paid by their current employer and, in all cases, must have been paid within the last 12 months. An annual bonus can be considered where it has only been paid in the most recent year. Payslips The number of payslips required is dependent on the frequency of the bonus. We need evidence of their annual bonus over the last 2 years. If your customer receives their bonus Quarterly then we need 8 payslips which evidence the bonus payment If your customer receives their bonus Half Yearly then we need 4 payslips which evidence the bonus payment If your customer receives their bonus Annually then we need 2 payslips which evidence the bonus payment Note - You can use the payslips to show annual bonuses over the last 2 years (We dont need P60s to validate, and we require no additional calculations). P60s Where your customer cant provide the required payslips, we need to confirm the annual bonus is sustainable using the last 2 years P60s. P60s are only acceptable where the customer is not also in receipt of regular bonus, overtime or commission. Obtain the P60s to confirm bonus over the last 2 years. Calculate the annual bonus figure for both years If the latest years bonus figure is lower than the previous years, you can only use the latest years figure. If it is higher than the previous years you can use an average of the two years Calculate Overtime or commission Identify if monthly* overtime/commission is showing on at least 1 of the most recent 3 months* payslips Average the total monthly* overtime/commission amounts from the last 3 months* payslips and use the same payslips to compare the annualised figure against the P60 Youll need to deduct the salary, allowances and any bonus payments that are less frequent than monthly (or more) when reviewing a P60 and calculating the monthly overtime/commission The remaining figure should then be divided by 12 to show the monthly average from the P60 Take the lower of the following 2 figures (unless the minimum 50% applies) 100% of the 3 months average 100% of the latest P60 monthly average **If frequency of pay is not monthly (e.g. bi weekly / 4 weekly / weekly), see weekly, 2-weekly or 4-weekly section below Examples Example 1 (evidenced on 3 consecutive most recent payslips) Basic = £20,000 - Monthly bonus (average over last 3 months) = £1,000 - P60 Total income = £23,000 Bonus amount (P60 value) = £3,000 (divided by 12 = £250 per month) Monthly bonus Figure to use = £500 per month Decision - As the P60 monthly average value after basic salary is deducted is less than 50% of the latest 3 payslips, the figure added to application is £500 per month (50% current average monthly bonus = £1,000 x 50%) Example 2 (evidenced on at least 1 out of 3 recent payslips) Basic annual income = £20,000 - Monthly overtime (average over last 3 months) = £1,000 per month - P60 Total annual income = £29,000 Less Basic annual income = £20,000 Overtime amount (P60 average value) = £9,000 (divided by 12 = £750 per month) Overtime Figure to use = £750 per month Decision - As the P60 monthly average value after basic salary is deducted is lower than 100% of the average of the latest 3 payslips, the figure added to MAX is £750 per month (use the lower of the 2 averages) Example 3 (evidenced on at least 1 out of 3 recent payslips) Basic annual income = £20,000 - Commission (average over last 3 months) = £1,000 per month - P60 Total annual income = £38,000 Less Basic annual income = £20,000 Commission amount (P60 average value) = £18,000 (divided by 12 = £1,500 per month) Commission Figure to use = £1,000 Decision - As the P60 monthly average value after basic salary is deducted is higher than 100% of average of the latest 3 payslips, the figure added to MAX is £1,000 per month (use the lower of the 2 averages) If income Then* Monthly Use latest months payslip figure 4-weekly Use latest months payslip figure Multiply this figure by 13 (for annual figure) Divide annual figure by 12 2-weekly Total figures from last 3 payslips Divide this by 6 (for averaged weekly pay) Multiply this by 52 (for annual figure) Divide this by 12 (for equivalent monthly figure) Weekly Total the figures from last 5 payslips Divide this figure by 5 (for averaged weekly figure) Multiply the average weekly figure by 52 (for annual figure) Divide annual figure by 12

  • Cladding/ The Building Safety Act 2022  Buy to Let Cladding/ The Building Safety Act 2022  Buy to Let The Building Safety Act 2022 provides protection from the remediation costs of replacing external combustible material where there is an agreed approach to remediation in place. Buildings that have external wall systems may require an EWS1 rating. Where a rating is A3 OR B2 this indicates some form of remediation is required. There are a variety of options available to leaseholders and Barclays made a commitment to help customers living in or buying impacted properties where there is a qualifying lease or planned remediation in place by a recognised body. To support applications for impacted properties that require remediation we will need one of the following to be provided to us with your clients mortgage application. Written confirmation of intention to complete the works from a developer who has signed a contact with the government. You can see a full list of developers who have signed the pledge on .GOV.UK A Building Safety Act 2022 Government Leaseholder Deed of Certificate Form accompanied by a Building Safety Act 2022 Landlords Certificate Written confirmation from a housing association confirming they are completing the remediation or written confirmation from DLUHC confirming the property is approved for funding to remediate. For letters from DLUHC, these should clearly state if any financial liability is passed to the leaseholder or be accompanied by a leaseholder or landlord certificate. Where your client provides the Landlord and Leaseholder certificates it is important to capture the financial commitment they will have. You can find the total sum payable on the landlord certificate within the work undertaken on relevant defects section. Any amount the client must pay will be taken over a 10-year period. Therefore, the amount due on Monday 14th February 2022, should be divided by 120 months and captured as or within the service charge to ensure affordability is met. Developer or Housing Association remediated properties will have no financial liability passed to the leaseholder and therefore will not impact affordability. Please note: if the application is for a property that requires fire safety remediation we will only proceed where we have satisfactory evidence in the format/s detailed above. In the event this cannot be provided we would be unable to support your customers mortgage application at this time. For customers who already hold their mortgage with Barclays against a property that requires remediation we can support rate switch applications, permission to let requests and conversion from BTL to residential or vice versa without evidence being required. Where any additional borrowing is required for existing customers, the rules detailed would apply.
  • The Building Safety Act 2022 provides protection from the remediation costs of replacing external combustible material where there is an agreed approach to remediation in place.
  • Buildings that have external wall systems may require an EWS1 rating. Where a rating is A3 OR B2 this indicates some form of remediation is required.
  • There are a variety of options available to leaseholders and Barclays made a commitment to help customers living in or buying impacted properties where there is a qualifying lease or planned remediation in place by a recognised body.
  • To support applications for impacted properties that require remediation we will need one of the following to be provided to us with your clients mortgage application.
  • Written confirmation of intention to complete the works from a developer who has signed a contact with the government. You can see a full list of developers who have signed the pledge on .GOV.UK
  • A Building Safety Act 2022 Government Leaseholder Deed of Certificate Form accompanied by a Building Safety Act 2022 Landlords Certificate
  • Written confirmation from a housing association confirming they are completing the remediation or written confirmation from DLUHC confirming the property is approved for funding to remediate. For letters from DLUHC, these should clearly state if any financial liability is passed to the leaseholder or be accompanied by a leaseholder or landlord certificate.
  • Where your client provides the Landlord and Leaseholder certificates it is important to capture the financial commitment they will have. You can find the total sum payable on the landlord certificate within the work undertaken on relevant defects section.
  • Any amount the client must pay will be taken over a 10-year period. Therefore, the amount due on Monday 14th February 2022, should be divided by 120 months and captured as or within the service charge to ensure affordability is met.
  • Developer or Housing Association remediated properties will have no financial liability passed to the leaseholder and therefore will not impact affordability.
  • Please note: if the application is for a property that requires fire safety remediation we will only proceed where we have satisfactory evidence in the format/s detailed above. In the event this cannot be provided we would be unable to support your customers mortgage application at this time.

Applicants employed in professional roles where contracts are provided on a fixed term basis, but each contract rolls to the next placement and so the overarching employment does not change (i.e. Junior Doctors, Teachers, Junior Solicitors), should be keyed as employed.

The resulting weekly amount should then be multiplied by 46 working weeks to arrive at the gross annual income for affordability purposes. Additional commitments (where daily-rate is used) - When the daily-rate calculation is being used; credit commitments for which the limited company is liable/responsible (e.g. business loans, including bounce back loans) should be recorded within the application and considered as part of the overall affordability assessment. On the application, the monthly payment should be entered as shown on the business bank statements, the outstanding balance detailed as £1 and the remaining term as 1y 0m.

(Where the loan amount is below £1m the affordability assessment will be based on the applicants directors salary and dividends only. PAT cannot be taken into consideration. The borrower(s) collectively own greater than 50% of the companys shares. The maximum amount of Limited Company PAT that can be considered as part of the overall affordability assessment is the lower of: 50% of the three-year average Limited Company PAT, or 50% of the Limited Company PAT for the latest trading year. The amount of PAT used will be determined by the percentage shareholding of the applicant. E.g. where the borrower is a 70% shareholder a maximum 35% of PAT can be considered (50% of 70%) The Maximum amount of PAT used towards affordability cannot exceed 5x the average {Salary + Dividends} paid to the applicant(s) over 2 most recent years, as evidenced by the 2 latest tax calculations.

Valuations - Buy to Let Valuations - Buy to Let To be able to lend on a property, Barclays requires a valuation to be carried out. When you apply for a Barclays mortgage, the valuation type depends on whether your mortgage will be on a residential or Buy to Let basis. The mortgage valuation is our standard report for all residential applications and includes a description of the property, an opinion of the market value of the property as at the date of inspection, and an estimate of the current cost to reinstate the property in its present form (where appropriate). Its important to remember that the mortgage valuation is a report which is primarily for Barclays purposes and confirms whether the property is suitable security for a mortgage  it is not a survey. As such, we ask that all clients consider instructing a separate survey to provide them with a more detailed assessment of the condition of the property. Your client may wish to contact Countrywide Surveying Services on 0800 012 6995 *, e.surv on 0800 169 9661 *, or any other provider to discuss the different survey options available. More information on the types of survey available can be seen found on the Home Surveys section of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors website. Please note that if your clients do instruct their own survey, this will be a separate contract between them and their chosen survey provider with separate fees applying. Barclays will always rely on the mortgage valuation for the purpose of agreeing the mortgage. Automated valuation model (AVM) For Buy to Let remortgages and further advances on properties up to £1m in value (up to £2m in London and South East), where the loan to value required is 65% (subject to product availability) or less, we use AVMs to assist with instant mortgage decisions. Whether you apply through MAX or via other online systems*, the use of AVMs will help speed up the decision and offer a better process for your customer. AVMs are only suitable for further borrowing where the latest valuation was a physical one  i.e. not an AVM. * For example, via MTE or Trigold.
