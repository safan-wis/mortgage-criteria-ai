Cladding
HomeA - F
This section relates to customers who are looking to purchase, or who already own a property impacted by potentially unsafe cladding or balconies. These are known as External Wall Systems (EWS).

Multi storey buildings which have multiple occupancy and are either:

Under 11 metres AND 4 storeys or less, anywhere in the UK, or
11 metres or more OR 5 storeys or more, in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland
Our valuation policy will ensure that a professional valuation is undertaken for these properties. Where the valuer has fire safety concerns with the External Wall System or any other fire safety concerns, they will request a completed External Wall Fire Review Form (EWS1), in line with RICS guidance. Our appointed valuer will check their database to confirm the property’s EWS1 status. Where they are unable to do so, we will request the EWS1 form. The EWS1 form should be sent directly to us.

The EWS1 form is the responsibility of the building owner (property owner in Scotland) to undertake. They must appoint a qualified member of one of the appropriate professional bodies to complete and sign the form. The form will confirm that the EWS has been assessed and provide it’s safety rating. The rating will determine whether we are able to progress the case.

A rating of A1, A2 or B1 will mean that the valuer will determine whether the case can progress and where acceptable, provide an amended valuation report.

A rating of A3 or B2 will mean that the property will be declined where affected by cladding and remediation is required.

Multi storey buildings in England which have multiple occupancy and are either:

11 metres or more, or
Have 5 or more storeys
Where a valuer has identified any significant fire safety concerns, or the EWS1 form rating is either A3 or B2, they’ll let us know if remediation of the property has been agreed to be funded by either Government funding or by the Developer, if known. We’ll then get in touch requesting the following:

An executed Leaseholder Deed of Certificate.
An executed Landlord Certificate (for applications where the building is being fully remediated under the Building Safety Act or by the Developer, this certificate will not be required).
Please note that we aren’t accepting applications from non-qualifying leaseholders for buildings that are not being remediated under the Building Safety Act.

We must be satisfied with the information provided to allow us to proceed. You can find more guidance on this documentation on the government website

Existing Mortgage Customers

We are here to support our existing customers who have a mortgage on a property that is impacted by potentially unsafe EWS. When their current mortgage deal ends we will offer a new mortgage product, just as we always would.

For changes to an existing Virgin Money mortgage we will assess each case based on individual circumstances. As a responsible lender, any application for additional borrowing from customers impacted by unsafe EWS will be carefully considered before a decision is made. For any other questions relating to EWS please refer to the FAQs provided by RICS or visit the governments website to view their guidance on cladding.

#### Buy to Let Mortgage Details

  - Capital & Interest: Up to 80% of the property value.
  - Interest Only: Up to 80% of the property value.

This includes Greater London (postcodes starting with E, EC, N, NW, SE, SW, W, WC, BR, CR, DA, EN, HA, IG, KT, RM, SM, TW, or UB) as well as Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, East Sussex, Hampshire, Isle of Wight, Kent, Oxfordshire, Surrey, and West Sussex.




Minimum term
HomeM - R
5 years (or the product term if longer).




Mortgage free property-unencumbered
HomeM - R
One free standard valuation is available on properties worth £3m, or less.

Please ensure your clients solicitor is listed on the bank's Approved Legal Panel




Multi unit freehold blocks (MUFBs)
HomeM - R
A multi unit freehold block is a single freehold building which contains 2 or more self-contained units which don’t have their own individual leases.

We can accept MUFBs where the property is split into a maximum of 4 self-contained flats (no shared kitchen, bathroom, etc), each let on a single tenancy agreement with its own utilities. Each flat must have an internal floor area of at least 30sq.m. The property should be a house which has been converted into flats, but the building has been left on a single freehold title without the creation of individual leases for each flat. Our security will be the freehold title upon which we would place a single mortgage.

For all types of property our valuers must be able to find suitably comparable properties in the area and must be able to confirm there is suitable demand for the type of property in its area. This can be a particular challenge for MUFBs, and consequently we are more likely to be able to assist with higher value properties which present as simple and common house conversions in areas of particularly high demand and transactional volume.

If the flats were on individual leasehold titles, we would require separate mortgage applications per flat.




Neighbouring Land
HomeM - R
Where the applicant owns land that neighbours the security property, we will need a mortgage over the neighbouring land as well. 

This will only apply if:

 -- Access to the security property is gained over the neighbouring land; and/or
 -- Services for the security property run over the neighbouring land.
This won’t apply where the applicant owns multiple flats in a building.
 



### New Build
**Home Category: M - R**

A property is considered a "new build" if it meets any of the following criteria:

- It has never been occupied, including converted properties where the property has remained unoccupied since the conversion was completed.
- It is a property built or marketed by the builder or developer within the last 2 years, regardless of whether it has been previously tenanted.
- It has been converted into a flat within the 2 years preceding the mortgage application, as part of the conversion of a former mill, factory, school, church, council tower block, or similar structure.

#### Buy to Let Maximum Loan to Value (LTV)
The maximum LTV depends on the property type:

- **House:** Up to 80% of the property value.
- **Flat or Maisonette:** Up to 70% of the property value.

**Important Note:** A new build property must be covered by an NHBC Certificate or an equivalent form of guarantee cover. Acceptable policies for lending purposes, as approved by the Council of Mortgage Lenders, can be viewed in the UK Finance Mortgage Lenders Handbook.

#### Incentives
- **Cash Incentives:**  
  Cash incentives are allowed up to 5% of the purchase price. This includes cashback deals, Stamp Duty paid, payment of professional fees (e.g., solicitors, surveyors, etc.), and guaranteed rental payments for a specific period. All these are considered cash incentives.

- **Non-Cash Incentives:**  
  Non-cash incentives include items fixed or fitted to the property or white goods. These are accepted without affecting the loan amount.






  ### Offset Mortgages
**Home Category: M - R**

#### What Types of Accounts Can Be Linked to Our Offset Mortgages?
Clydesdale Bank’s current and savings accounts have been updated with a Virgin Money makeover, allowing you to link a broader range of Virgin Money accounts to a Clydesdale Bank offset mortgage. The account must have a sort code starting with 82. We offer both current products available for sale and products no longer available to new customers but still eligible for linking if the customer already holds them.

- **Current Available Products (Eligible for Linking):**
  - Club M Account
  - Club M Saver Account
  - M Plus Account
  - M Plus Saver

- **Products No Longer Available (Still Eligible if Held):**
  - Private Current Account
  - Private Savings Account
  - Current Account Control
  - Current Account Tracker
  - Savings Account Plus
  - Savings Account Plus – Offset
  - Offset Business Current Account

**Note:** Virgin Money current and savings accounts are not automatically opened during the Clydesdale Bank offset mortgage application process. Customers must arrange this separately.

A customer can link up to 6 Virgin Money accounts (any combination of eligible current and savings accounts) to their Clydesdale Bank offset mortgage. If only one account is linked, it must be a Virgin Money current account.

#### Opening Virgin Money Current and Savings Accounts
For new business applications, we will proactively contact your customer at the offer stage to help them open a personal current or savings account to link with their new offset mortgage upon completion. We will attempt two phone calls and send two follow-up emails before finalizing the process. We’ll also keep you updated to ensure everything is on track.

#### How Does an Offset Mortgage Work?
The interest a customer pays on their mortgage is calculated based on the outstanding mortgage balance minus the amount in their linked savings accounts. For example, with a £500,000 mortgage and £100,000 in a linked savings account, interest is only charged on the remaining £400,000. No interest is earned on the linked savings, but customers retain full access to their funds if needed. The more money in credit balances, the more interest they can save.

**Key Point:** Even if the savings balance grows, the monthly mortgage payment remains unchanged. However, a larger portion of the payment goes toward reducing the mortgage balance, saving more on interest. For repayment mortgages, this can also help shorten the loan term.

#### Can a Customer Link a Yorkshire Bank Account to Their Offset Mortgage?
No, only Clydesdale Bank products (with a sort code starting with 82) can be linked to an offset mortgage.

#### How Does an Interest Only Offset Mortgage Work?
For interest-only mortgages, the offset benefit allows a portion of the monthly payment to reduce the outstanding capital balance. However, offsetting does not lower the monthly payment amount. Customers must continue paying the full monthly amount as outlined in their mortgage offer.

#### What Happens If a Customer Fully Offsets Their Mortgage Balance?
If the total credit balance across the offset portfolio exceeds the mortgage balance, the customer pays no interest. Their monthly repayment then reduces the capital (outstanding balance), and they earn credit interest on the overall offset balance. For a detailed breakdown of interest charged, customers can contact our Mortgage Services Team at 0800 121 4203.







### Portability

#### Customers Who Need to Change the Parties Named on the Mortgage When Moving Home
- **Where parties are changing:** The portable balance is evenly divided between the current named parties.
- **Additional funds:** Any additional funds can be applied from our existing customer on-sale product range.
- **If a party doesn’t wish to port:** They can still receive up to a 50% share of the total Early Repayment Charge refund by using the ‘Moving your mortgage’ form on our Tools and Guides page. This allows the remaining party(ies) to port up to the full balance.
  - **Customer Intent:** If a customer intends to make use of this policy, please ensure a completed form accompanies your application submission.
  - **Refund Process:** The Early Repayment Charge refund will be administered upon completion of the new loan agreement.

#### Support
If you have any questions, get in touch with your Business Development Manager, who will do everything they can to help.






### Portfolio Landlords
**Home Category: M - R**

We can only lend to portfolio landlords if they are requesting a remortgage with no additional borrowing.

For customers looking to borrow additional money or buy a new Buy to Let (BTL) property, we can only assist if they do not meet the definition of a portfolio landlord—defined as borrowers with four or more mortgaged BTL properties. This includes any BTLs held in a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), and for joint applications, all mortgages are considered whether held together or separately.

To help you determine if we can assist your customers, here’s a breakdown based on the number of mortgaged BTLs they already have:

- If they have 0 mortgaged BTLs, they can buy a new BTL, convert an existing residential property to a BTL, remortgage with extra borrowing, or remortgage with no extra borrowing.
- If they have 1 mortgaged BTL, they can buy a new BTL, convert an existing residential property to a BTL, remortgage with extra borrowing, or remortgage with no extra borrowing.
- If they have 2 mortgaged BTLs, they can buy a new BTL, convert an existing residential property to a BTL, remortgage with extra borrowing, or remortgage with no extra borrowing.
- If they have 3 mortgaged BTLs, they cannot buy a new BTL or convert an existing residential property to a BTL, but they can remortgage with no extra borrowing.
- If they have 4 or more mortgaged BTLs, they cannot buy a new BTL or convert an existing residential property to a BTL, but they can remortgage with no extra borrowing.

*Note: The count of mortgaged BTLs should include all mortgages with any lender, not just Clydesdale Bank.*

**Limits:**
- The maximum number of BTLs with Clydesdale Bank is 3, with a maximum total borrowing of £1 million (£1.5 million if £500k or more of the mortgages are on properties in the Greater London area).
- We cannot lend to anyone who has more than 8 BTLs in their portfolio, whether or not they are mortgaged.




Probationary Periods
HomeM - R
If the customer is in probation or has not been in their current job for 6 months, this is acceptable as long as they hav a permanent contract (as opposed to short term) and they've received their first payslip.

Procurement fee
HomeM - R
Procuration fees will be paid in accordance with your contract with the Bank.





Product Switching
HomeM - R

We allow product switching on pipeline cases, which means you can switch your customer’s previously selected product onto a new product from our new business range available at that time. Here’s some key information -

-- We allow a change of product using the current product range as many times as needed prior to completion.
-- This can be pre-offer or post-offer, up until we have received the Certificate of Title from the solicitor. We can’t make changes to the product after the COT has been received.
-- Complete our Change of Application Form and upload it on the application portal.
-- Once we’ve changed the product, we’ll send a new offer to the customer. If the case is not yet at offer stage, we’ll send an updated illustration instead.

Please note: We allow product switching on Product Transfer pipeline cases for existing customers too.





Product fee
HomeM - R
 The product fee can be added to the loan, provided the total borrowing does not exceed 95% LTV for a residential loan, or 80% LTV for Buy to Let.

Please see the Loan To Value section for more information on our LTV restrictions




### Product Transfer
**Home Category: M - R**

Your customer can apply for a product transfer up to 180 days before the expiry of their current fixed-rate product.

#### Applicable Criteria
The following conditions must be met for your customer’s mortgage:
- Payments are currently up to date.
- There has been no change in the use of the property, such as it still being their main residence.
- There has been no deterioration in the customer’s financial circumstances that could impact their ability to meet mortgage repayments.
- There has been no change to the regulatory status of the mortgage.

#### Important Notes
- **Valuation:** If the valuation figure provided in the application exceeds the value we currently hold on file, we will arrange an index valuation at no cost to the client to determine the loan-to-value ratio.
- **Offset:** Any linked accounts will remain in place for a new offset mortgage. However, if your client opts for a fixed-rate mortgage, they will lose the ability to offset personal or business accounts once the new fixed-rate mortgage begins.

#### Additional Options
During the final 3 months of a new product switch application, customers can make further amendments to their mortgage without incurring an Early Repayment Charge. These include:
- Making a lump sum reduction to the mortgage.
- Eligibility to access previously overpaid funds through a borrow-back option.

All our current on-sale products are available to product transfer customers, provided the above criteria and product conditions are met. For full product information, please visit our Products pages.




### Proof of Rental Payments
**Home Category: M - R**

We accept the following documents from the client to evidence the rental income they are receiving from their existing buy-to-let properties:

- **Property Rental Income:**
  - **Tenancy Agreement:** Must be current, in standard form, and signed by all parties. Note that this is not suitable as evidence for rental income from the property being mortgaged.
  - **OR**
  - **Bank Statements:** Copies of the last 3 months’ statements must be held on file with rental income annotated.

In addition, for any new Buy to Let properties, we will instruct a professional valuation and use the rental income estimated by the valuer within our application.




### Property
**Home Category: M - R**

#### Unacceptable Properties
This section provides general guidance on the types of properties that the bank will not consider for lending. This list is not exhaustive, and any queries not covered here should be directed to us before submitting an application.

We do not lend on the following types of property:
- Properties with agricultural restrictions.
- Freehold flats or maisonettes.
- Live/work units.
- Properties altered or adapted for commercial use, including those where part of the land is leased to a third party for commercial or other purposes.
- Mobile homes or river boats.
- Shared equity properties.
- Low-cost housing or properties under restricted resale covenant schemes.
- Sheltered housing or properties with age restrictions for occupants.
- Properties that cannot be occupied for 365 days per year.
- Care homes, kennels, catteries, caravan parks, and working farms, which are considered predominantly commercial and unsuitable for residential mortgages.
- Studio flats with internal floor space less than 30 square meters.
- Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs).
- Properties with charges of part, where our mortgage does not cover the entire property or title number.
- Properties with a flying freehold element exceeding 15% of the gross floor area.

If you have any queries not listed, please contact us initially.

#### Buy to Let
We will consider residential properties in either owner-occupied or predominantly tenanted areas. Decisions will take into account the demand for purchasing and renting the specific type of property being considered.

#### Minimum Energy Efficiency Standards (MEES)
Regulations effective from April 1, 2018, require that a property’s Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) must show an energy rating of E or above to be let, subject to certain exemptions. For all Buy to Let (BTL) cases, the bank’s valuers will verify compliance with MEES. If the EPC does not meet this standard, the application will be declined as unsuitable security for BTL lending.

#### Ex-Local Authority Flats/Maisonettes
Mortgages and remortgages on former local authority flats and maisonettes in blocks of 7 storeys or less are acceptable, provided the property meets our guidelines. However, deck or balcony access that is deemed detrimental to the use or value of the flat will lead to a decline. Acceptable properties must have suitable entrance doors to stairwells and be located in areas with good owner-occupier demand.

#### Flats Above/Adjacent to Commercial Premises
Properties located above or adjacent to commercial premises are acceptable, subject to a valuer’s assessment ensuring the commercial use does not negatively impact demand or enjoyment of the property. The entrance must not be via the commercial premises, and properties immediately above or adjacent to food, drink, or dry cleaners are typically unacceptable.

#### Land/Large Acreage
The valuation will include a maximum of 2 acres of land, which will form the security for Clydesdale Bank. Any added value from additional land will not be included in the valuation. While there is no strict overall limit, we consider saleability in relation to the size and type of residence.

#### New Home Guarantees
Properties built or converted within the last 10 years must be covered by an acceptable warranty or a professional consultant’s certificate, which cannot be offered retrospectively. Acceptable warranties include:
- Advantage HCI
- Build Assure
- Build Zone
- Building Life Plans (BLP)
- Castle 10 / Checkmate
- Global Home Warranties
- Homeproof (formerly Aedis)
- International Construction Warranties (ICW)
- Local Authority Building Control (LABC)
- National House Building Council (NHBC)
- Premier Guarantee
- Protek
- Q Assure
- Thomas Miller Specialty Construction

We also accept a UK Finance standard professional consultant’s certificate for a single dwelling or a flat converted from a single dwelling, but not for new build flats or developments with more than one dwelling. This is subject to meeting section 6.7 requirements of the UK Finance handbook for England and Wales and Scotland, including appropriate professional indemnity insurance and membership in an approved professional body.

We do not lend on property conversions prior to or during construction. Larger scheme conversions, such as office-to-residential with a builder/developer selling multiple units, will be evaluated similarly to new build lending on the completed property only.

#### Freehold Flats
We do not accept freehold flats.

#### High Rise Blocks of Flats
We accept properties in blocks taller than 7 storeys under the following conditions:
- The block was originally constructed for owner occupation, not local authority housing.
- New or recently constructed/converted blocks, where the mortgaged property is for full owner occupation or shared ownership, are likely acceptable subject to valuation.
- The block must have a concrete or steel frame with an external face of brick, block, or other robust cladding (e.g., stone, glass, or metal).
- Access to flats on the 5th floor or above must include a lift; otherwise, the application will be declined.
- For flats on the 4th storey or below, a lift is not required regardless of the block’s height.


**Japanese Knotweed**

Japanese Knotweed is categorised as:

- **Category A**: Causing visible damage to the property.
- **Category B**: Impacting the amenity space of the property.
- **Category C**: Within the boundaries but not impacting the amenity space of the property.
- **Category D**: On a neighbouring property or land.

- For categories A & B, the surveyor will usually request a report by a PCA or ISSE registered firm. All recommended remedial works must be undertaken and covered by an insurance-backed 10-year guarantee, which must be property-specific and transferable to subsequent owners and mortgagees in possession. Funding for the works must be ring-fenced and protected by bond-pay, escrow, or similar.
- For categories C & D, we are usually able to lend with no further requirements.



**Occupancy Restrictions**

We will not accept the following occupancy restrictions:
- Holiday Lets
- Unable to occupy a property for 365 days per year

- Section 106 (any, including affordable housing, for example any re-sale restrictions geographically or by person type)

- Live / Work units
- Construction - Standard and Non-Standard

**Standard Construction for Residential Properties**
- Main walls are of masonry (brick, block, or stone) with cavity or solid walls.
- Main walls of modern timber frame with a masonry external skin are classed as standard construction.
- Main walls of modern steel frame with a masonry external skin are classed as standard construction if originally constructed with an NHBC guarantee.
- Main pitched roof covering is tiled, slated, or a modern metal sheet roof (not corrugated iron).
- Main flat roof covering is felt, asphalt, or GRP (up to 100% purpose-built flats, 25% other properties).
- Main roof structure is of timber cut or trussed, or a steel framework.

**Properties of Non-Standard Construction**
- If the property is of a non-standard form of construction, it will be considered on an individual basis.
- The property must be well maintained and in satisfactory condition.
- A suitable demand and market for the property is essential, as recommended and confirmed by the valuer.
- A suitable new build warranty is also required.
- Timber clad properties are unacceptable.
- For any other non-standard construction type, please contact us in the first instance.

**Modern Methods of Construction (MMC)**
- Each form of construction will be considered individually on its merits.
- Each property requires a physical inspection and valuation by one of the Bank’s Valuers, who will advise on condition, marketability, and saleability.
- As a minimum, MMC properties must have the necessary unqualified NHBC guarantees or similar, and BPS 2020 & BPS 2021 certification for materials used.
- The property should be in a location where marketability is not an issue and must be acceptable to insurers.
- If you have an MMC property, please contact us in the first instance.

**Timber Framed Construction**
- Modern factory-produced timber-framed construction, generally by major house builders since the 1960s, is acceptable if constructed with an outer skin of brick/stone or rendered blockwork, subject to individual inspection and valuer satisfaction with construction methods, site supervision, and storage facilities on new properties and developments.
- Lightweight thin claddings (e.g., rendered boarding, timber like shiplap, or similar) are generally not acceptable unless decorative and a relatively small proportion of the wall surface.
- Some modern timber-framed dwellings with a cement render finish on expanded metal mesh or similar, applied directly to the timber frame, are acceptable if they have NHBC approval and TRADA certification, subject to valuer comments.
- "Lightweight" Softwood Timber Frames are not acceptable (e.g., "between the wars" timber "garden shed" construction, often with asbestos sheet cladding and roofs of asbestos tiles or felt).
- Medieval and/or Historic Timber Frame Houses are acceptable, subject to individual inspection and saleability, if made of hardwood timber framed construction with infill material.

**Escalating Ground Rent**
- We will consider properties where the lease contains a provision for a periodic increase of the ground rent, provided the amount remains reasonable throughout the term of the lease.
- Any increase must be linked to the equivalent percentage change in the Retail Price Index (RPI) or a similar index.
- If subject to a multiplier, any multipliers causing a doubling of rent every period of 15 years or less are not permitted.
- If you are unsure if the lease terms are unreasonable, please refer the details to us.

Remortgage - the switching package


HomeM - R
We offer a range of products with a remortgage package of one free valuation and free basic legal work. The free valuation is available for properties valued up to £3m. If the property is valued over £3m the full valuation fee is payable. The maximum property value for free basic legal work is £2m, and there is no maximum loan size. The package also applies to capital raising on an unencumbered property.

We’ll choose a firm to complete the free basic legal work under the package. Additional costs specific to the customer’s circumstances may apply and the customer will be provided a tariff of charges by the firm acting when they’re appointed. There will always be at a funds transfer fee of up to £35 to send remortgage funds to the existing mortgage provider or the customer’s bank account.



#### Free basic legal work eligibility

 Most transactions are eligible for the free basic legal work but it’s not available where any documents require execution under a Power of Attorney or for property held in trust.

In the following circumstances (not exhaustive) the standard legal fees incentive is available but additional fees usually apply: Transfer of equity, stair-casing to 100% ownership, Joint Borrower Sole Owner, charges on the title, solar panel leases, 3rd party solicitor involvement, restrictions on title.

Solicitors

Clydesdale Bank have an approved panel of solicitors and licensed conveyancers to provide legal services to customers buying a property and remortgaging. For further information including the list of the approved firms, please visit the Clydesdale Bank Approved Legal Panel page.



Telegraphic transfer
HomeS - Z
All advance monies will be transferred to the solicitor/ licensed conveyancer at the time of completion. A fee of £40.00 will be deducted from the loan on completion. Payment for this service does not need to be collected separately from your client.



Term
HomeS - Z

We will accept Buy to Let mortgages with a minimum term of 5 years up to a maximum term of 40 years. In addition, we will consider applications for Buy to Let lending up the age of 75 at the end of the mortgage term.When considering the applicants age, it is important that the below criteria are followed:

-- The age to be used is that at the date of application
-- Where there is more than one applicant, the age used is that of the oldest applicant.
-- Where lending will take an individual past their stated retirement age then their retirement income must be evidenced.



Transcripts
HomeS - Z
Scottish property valuations

We can accept a transcript from the Scottish Home Report (Single Survey) subject to the valuation not being more than 90 days' old and the surveying firm / surveyor being on the bank's valuation panel. A bank survey is needed for loans which fall outside this criteria. Transcripts are not acceptable for BTL applications.





Undervalue transactions
HomeS - Z
Transactions at undervalue can occur where a property is being or has been acquired by way of a Deed of Gift, or for less than the full market value. For such a transaction to be acceptable to us there must be an existing associated relationship with the Vendor.

When the Loan to Value figure for these transactions are calculated, the lower of the purchase price and property valuation (i.e. the discounted price) is to be used, both the purchase price and the valuation amount need to be detailed within the application.

Applications will be considered up to 100% of the purchase price and the approval is subject to the normal credit requirements and conditions.

We also require the solicitor or licensed conveyancer to establish that the family member gifting the property is not insolvent and to arrange suitable indemnity insurance for the full value of the property if they deem it necessary.

Note: When an applicant is purchasing a property from a family member separate legal representation is required, the same solicitor or licensed conveyancer cannot act for both seller and buyer.



Valuation fees
HomeS - Z
We will ask our valuation panel manager to carry out all valuations required by Clydesdale Bank. The fee scales for a Mortgage Valuation are provided on the valuation fees page.
Any customers who wish to have a Homebuyers survey carried out, must arrange this with the surveyor directly. For help with finding a local surveyor you can visit the RICS website.
