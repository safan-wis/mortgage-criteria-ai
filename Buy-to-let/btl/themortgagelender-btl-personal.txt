Base Rate
BASE RATE
The Mortgage Lender Residential and Buy to Let Base Rate: 4%
We may use our Residential Base Rate or our Buy to Let Base Rate to determine the variable interest rate if you have a tracker mortgage, or if your initial fixed rate has ended.
The product details provided on your European Standardised Information Sheet (ESIS) or illustration will tell you which reference rate applies and the margin that is added to it to calculate the variable interest rate.
We will write to you to notify you of any change to the variable interest rate at the same time as notifying you of the change to your monthly payment:

Under what circumstances will our Base Rates change?
Our Residential and Buy to Let Base Rates are variable rates which are set by us. They are not directly linked to the Bank of England Base Rate, and we are not required to change them to track any increase or decrease in the Bank of England Base Rate, but they may be influenced by changes in the Bank of England Base Rate.
In line with the mortgage Terms and Conditions, we are only able to increase either of our Base Rates if it is fair and reasonable and for the following reasons:
A change in the costs of funds we use in our lending business to fund your mortgage (this may include for example where the interest rates on the money we use to fund your mortgage change);
Changes in any applicable UK or European legislation, including those about taxation;
Orders of a UK court, regulator or competent authority: or
Changes in any applicable law or regulation.
We can reduce either of our Base Rates for any reason.
The Bank of England website provides details of
historic and current Bank Rates

About us
What do we do? Well, the clue’s in the name – we love to lend. 

We recognise people don’t fit into neat boxes. We live and breath for the complex and are creating models for lending, that through respect and collaboration, are designed for real people.

Real Life Lending is at the heart of our brand, and in the DNA of everything we do. Simply put it means we aim to find solutions to help those that might not fit the standard criteria offered by high street lenders.

If you’re a mortgage intermediary and have a question or a case to discuss, contact us on: 0344 257 0418.

From today, Monday 14th July, we've made changes to both our Residential and Buy to Let criteria. 

📃 Working VISAs: Clients employed on a Skilled Worker (formerly Tier 2) or Health & Care VISA may be eligible for a mortgage up to 90% LTV.

🏡 We are expanding our buy-to-let criteria to support landlords who have previously lived in a property or inherited one, and are now letting it out.

FOR INTERMEDIARIES ONLY
We’ve made moves in Buy-to-Let in the last 6 months:
⭐ First time landlords max loan size increased to £500k and expanded eligibility on HMO and MUB applications
⭐ Increased max LTV to 80%
⭐ Rates on our core range now start from 3.49%
⭐ Limited edition products
⭐ And not forgetting 𝐏𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐟𝐨𝐥𝐢𝐨 𝐄𝐱𝐩𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐬 where we'll assess portfolio clients and if approved, a master case file will be saved for 12 months so any subsequent cases during this time will be subject to minimum admin! 

Catch up on all the changes and view our full Buy-to-Let range on our website -

Maximum age
80 years at application, 95 years at end of term.
Spouses
A nonexpatriate spouse can be accepted but where one/more of the applicants is UK based, the overall application will still be processed as an Expat case.

You get a mortgage that works for you. Because we know one thing doesn’t work for everyone. Our mortgage lending fits your circumstances, not the other way round.
If you have a mortgage with us, here are all the ways we can help.

Adjusting for Affordability
ADJUSTING FOR AFFORDABILITY
The cost of living crisis has impacted 9 in 10 adults in the UK. Record-high inflation and soaring interest rates have pushed up the prices of everything, from food to heating.
Homeowners are feeling the pinch too, with a surge in monthly bills and complexities for renters, remortgagers and first-time buyers.
Our latest research project explores the real-life impact of the cost of living crisis. We spoke to real people, with real stories on their lived experiences and gathered invaluable feedback.
For brokers like you, it’s a chance to gain practical insight on how to help clients navigate this challenging time.

SURGES IN ENERGY & UTILITY COSTS,
NEW DEBT &
EXTREME MEASURES
In our first gathering of research, we realised the extent people are going to when trying to keep pace with mounting costs. Consumers are missing energy bills, young people are taking on debt through pay-day loans and high-risk adjustments are being made, regardless of health and safety concerns.

MORTGAGE RENEWAL PRICE
HIKES & ALTERNATIVE INCOME
STREAMS
Our second survey highlights the increased costs of mortgages renewals, plus the rising costs of monthly mortgage payments. How will the Bank of England’s base rate decisions impact future borrowing costs? And why are homeowners taking on second jobs, bringing in lodgers and downsizing their properties?

ECONOMIC
INSTABILITY, ENERGY
EFFICIENT HOMES & DEMAND FOR
TRANSPARENCY
In our third survey, we found out that buyers and sellers are halting their plans and worrying about whether they’ll ever be able to afford to move. Moving onto or up the property ladder feels out of reach and renters are calling on the government for more transparency, energy efficient homes and lower interest rates.

COMPLEX INCOMES,
MORTGAGE
CHALLENGES &
DELAYED
APLLICATIONS
In our fourth survey, we identified a real obstacle for those with complex incomes – securing a mortgage. Why are freelancers and people on zero-hour contracts viewed as high-risk? How can we help them get onto the property ladder? And why is it taking so long for first-time buyers to apply for a mortgage? Is there more we can do to help them prepare?

Conclusion
The cost of living crisis has caused significant challenges for all kinds of people at all stages of life. An unstable economy has led to homeowners missing bill payments, taking on debt and creating extreme ways to afford life’s essentials.
Living standards are being compromised and people are emotionally and practically squeezed. So, they need our support more than ever.
We see homeowners as people, not statistics. We lend for real-life – meaning we look at cases on an individual basis, making fair, impartial decisions with a simple, flexible affordability criteria.
Together, we can give people options, which is more empowering than accepting consequences out of their control.

Adverse Credit Report
ADVERSE CREDIT REPORT
Adverse credit and why it matters
It’s estimated that around six million people in the UK have adverse credit. The pandemic has made the situation worse, and the hardest-hit demographic is the 18-34 age bracket - precisely the people who were already struggling to get on the property ladder.
For brokers like you, it’s an opportunity as well as a challenge. And we’ve just published an in-depth report about it.
Read our report now
What is adverse credit?
Anything that negatively impacts credit score and makes the high-street lenders reluctant to offer a mortgage is adverse credit. It could be formally recognised by CCJs, or it could just be a missed utility bill or a credit-card debt that’s got a little out of hand. Whatever the size and shape of adverse credit, it can wreck home-buying plans.
Our new report explains the triggers for adverse credit, and shows just how many Brits - especially young or self-employed Brits - could be missing out because of it.
What you can do about it
As an intermediary working with TML, you could be in a unique position to help clients overcome the hurdle of adverse credit. Because we look at each case you send us, individually and manually, we can often consider cases when the big high-street lenders won’t - largely because they base their decisions on automated credit scoring.
6 million Brits is a huge potential market, just waiting for someone like you to help.
The Real Life View from TML
The latest in the Mortgage Lender’s series of roundtable discussions brought together a host of big hitters from across our industry.
We were joined by brokers, thought leaders and industry gurus to discuss the challenges of complex incomes and adverse credit in today’s mortgage market.

We’re not the kind of bank that makes decisions simply because they will be more profitable or are the easy thing to do. We want to run our business in a sustainable way that creates positive impacts to all of our stakeholders - including the communities we operate in as well as our customers, our investors and third parties we work with. Our Environmental, Society and Governance (ESG) activities mean you can feel proud to work with a bank that does more than simply transact money.

Finance solutions to enable the provision of housing to communities

Wholesale funding for non-bank specialist lenders, powering competition in the market and enabling the provision of finance to underserved groups
Looking after our planet
We recognise that climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time and, as well as taking action to reduce our own carbon footprint, we want to play a key role in supporting our customers’ climate transition plans.

Shared Ownership
Shared Ownership
It’s important to have a greater range of solutions for all potential homebuyers, especially for those who may have smaller deposits. Shared Ownership (also known as ‘Part Own, Part Rent’) is all about giving your clients more options when it comes to getting onto the property ladder.
Customers with smaller deposits may be able to buy a home through the Shared Ownership scheme if they don’t have the whole deposit or can’t meet the full monthly mortgage payments for a home that meets their needs. It means they own a share of a property, rather than the whole property.
Our Shared Ownership range is available for properties with an EPC rating of A-C, with mortgages available up to 95% of the share being purchased, subject to a maximum 75% LTV of the open market value of the property.
There are some eligibility requirements we need to check before we can consider your client’s request.
Eligibility requirements:
Maximum 95% of purchased share, subject to maximum 75% LTV against open market value
Purchase only
For properties with EPC rating A-C
Self employed 12 months minimum trading acceptable
No minimum credit score
Minimum loan £25,001
Maximum loan £405,000
Up to 40 year term
RL0 and RL1 products only
Capital & Interest repayment only
No defaults or CCJs in the last 36 months
Outside of London, annual household income must be less than £80,000
In London, annual household income must be less than £90,000
In Wales, annual household income must be less than £60,000
Up to 2 missed payments on each unsecured credit agreement considered
Telecommunication and utilities defaults are not considered adverse credit
Arrears on unsecured credit balances under £500 are ignored
Find out all you need to know for you and your clients with our helpful
Residential Criteria Guides
and within our FAQs below.
Here you can find our frequently asked questions
What share of a property can clients buy?
Usually between 25% and 75% of the properties open market value (although this can be as low as 10% for some homes) can be purchased - with rent being paid on the remaining share which is owned typically by an approved Housing Association or other registered scheme providers.
Which shared ownership scheme providers are accepted?
We’ll accept Shared Ownership scheme providers registered in England and Wales with the
Homes and Communities Agency (Homes England)
, the
Welsh Assembly (Shared Ownership-Wales)
, and
Registered social landlords
.
What deposit will my client need?
As your client is buying a share of the property, they will only need a deposit based on that share, as opposed to full market value. At TML, we will consider lending with a 5% deposit of the share being purchased. Depending on the share bought, this could significantly reduce the deposit needed when compared to a standard property purchase.
Who is eligible for a Shared Ownership mortgage?
To be eligible for the Shared Ownership scheme, household income must be £80,000 a year or less (£90,000 in London & £60,000 in Wales). Customers must also be either first-time buyers, or previous homeowners, who cannot afford to buy a property with a standard mortgage. Arrangements must be through a registered Housing Association or other registered scheme providers. At present, TML Shared Ownership mortgages are available for purchase only.
Where can I find more information about Shared Ownership Schemes and Shared Ownership Mortgages
You can find more useful information on Shared Ownership on the gov.uk website – Shared ownership homes: buying, improving and selling: How shared ownership works -
GOV.UK

Real Life Earners Report
Welcome to our Real Life Earners Report
Some 4.4m individuals are now self-employed in the UK, encompassing a wide range of employments from highly paid consultants to freelancers, small businesses, gig economy workers and more. Yet, despite their success (and often high-income levels), many have had their mortgage applications rejected by traditional high street lenders. This is often because their income is viewed as being too volatile or seasonal. These earners are often more than, or just as, financially astute and reliable as those paid through PAYE (Pay as You Earn).
They may also benefit from  the ability to flex their incomes and increase them as needed, unlike more ‘conventional workers’. We specialise in providing our broker partners with Residential and Buy-to-Let mortgages for “real life” earners who don’t fit the high street’s cookie-cutter model. Instead, we provide solutions for a wide variety of employment and income types. As an industry leader, we work hard to keep on top of our audiences’ fast changing needs and carry out extensive research with brokers and end-customers.
This white paper details just some of the insights from our research on the obstacles the self-employed are facing and the successes they can have when accessing specialist mortgages tailored to their specific needs.

Supporting customers with characteristics of vulnerability
The FCA describes a vulnerable customer as someone who, due to their personal circumstances, is especially susceptible to detriment, particularly when a firm is not acting with appropriate levels of care.
All customers are at risk of becoming vulnerable and this risk is increased by characteristics of vulnerability related to four key drivers:
Driver
Examples of associated characteristics
Health
Physical disability, severe or long-term illness, hearing or visual impairment, mental health condition, or addiction
Life Events
Bereavement, relationship breakdown, domestic abuse (including financial abuse), or caring responsibilities
Resilience
Low savings, over-indebtedness, or low emotional resilience
Capability
Low knowledge or confidence in managing finances, poor literacy or numeracy skills, or poor English Language skills
We want everyone accessing our products and services to have a good outcome. When we’re aware of your client’s needs and circumstances, we can help support them better. This support may involve changing the way we communicate with the applicant(s), or adjusting our standard processes in line with the needs of the applicant(s).
Information regarding the applicant(s) characteristics of vulnerability, and any associated support needs, can be shared with us during the application process with the applicant’s permission, via our broker portal.
Any characteristics of vulnerability disclosed will not impact the outcome of an application.
Should the applicant(s) wish to share information regarding characteristics of vulnerability or support needs at any time after their initial application, this can be done by contacting our
Customer Support team on 0344 257 0427
or
customersupport@themortgagelender.com
Information shared with TML regarding the applicant/s characteristics of vulnerability will be processed and stored in line with applicable data protection requirements.

Real Life Borrowers Report
Welcome to our Real Life Borrowers Report
It’s time for some clarity. Behind the scaremongering headlines and political unease, some people are pausing their life plans to ease financial pressures and keep sight of their homeownership and property goals.
But why is this happening? And what do the public really think about it all?
To inspire confidence, we created an extensive research project aimed at getting inside the minds of potential customers. We delved deep into their current situations, money worries and future homeowner goals to find out what opportunities were being missed.
The result? A well-rounded piece of practical thinking that tells it like it is. For brokers, it’s an invaluable chance to explore the real-life impact with deep learning on customer thoughts, realities and needs.

First time buyers up against challenges to get onto the property ladder
In our first phase of research, we found that higher interest rates were pricing first-time-buyers out of the market. Many are opting for plan B, such as buying a smaller property, a fixer-upper or a house in a cheaper area. Shared ownership was also misunderstood, with many not even knowing what it meant.
Read more
Rejection worries discouraging self-employed from applying for a mortgage
Our second phase of research highlighted the lack of confidence self-employed people had in applying for mortgages. From believing they would not be approved, to thinking it’s harder to obtain a mortgage, we uncovered the top barriers to being your own boss and owning your own home.
Read more
A positive shift in market conditions driving BTL landlord positivity
Our third phase of research focused on the impact turbulent conditions had on BTL landlords. After an unstable period, our research showed a positive shift, with many feeling confident about the future, especially those with portfolios and HMOs properties.
Read more
Complex case customers are pausing their life plans due to rising costs
In our fourth phase of research, we identified the barriers of those with complex incomes. From renters putting home ownership goals on hold to those looking at smaller properties and ones in need of restoration, we’re seeing a gap in the market to help these customers become mortgage ready.
Read more
Conclusion
Our report is packed full of independent research stats and adds context to complex cases. Our research reached out to people from all walks of life and offers a well-rounded read that you can keep in mind when helping your clients.
With greater understanding, comes greater problem-solving. Together, we can give people options in line with their unique lending needs.

Conveyancing
LAWYERS UNITED
We make lending simple and buying easier, but your client will still need a solicitor to do the legal side of things. If your client doesn't already have a conveyancer in mind, they'll find one on our panel of experts.
New conveyancers can
apply to join our panel

Joint Representative Conveyancing
When your client instructs a firm from our panel (for a residential mortgage or an individual entering into a buy to let mortgage), we provide our instruction via LMS to act on a joint representation basis. Your client will need to negotiate their fees directly with the chosen firm and will be responsible for paying all the legal fees to the chosen conveyancing firm in connection with the mortgage.
If your client is a limited company please see the relevant section below.
View our conveyancing panel
NB: This list is for the purpose of identifying a suitable firm only. This list should not be downloaded, copied, exported or used for any other purpose.
Separate Representation Conveyancer
If your client has instructed a firm who are not on our panel (for a residential mortgage or an individual entering into a buy to let mortgage) or chooses to have separate representation, they must consider the following:
Their chosen legal firm must have 2 or more partners and be registered with the relevant law society or CLC.
TML will still instruct their own legal firm to complete the legal work on behalf of TML.
Your client will be responsible for instructing their conveyancing firm to represent them.
Your client will be responsible for all legal fees, from both firms, in connection with the mortgage.
Separate representation transactions can take longer to complete.
For indicative costs, customers should contact the separate representation firm directly.
Limited Company Buy to Let
If your client is purchasing or remortgaging a property owned by a limited company or limited partnership (whether in England & Wales or Scotland) then the firm acting for us must not only be on our residential panel (see above) but also be approved on our Limited Company Panel as well. Once a firm is approved on the Limited Company Panel then any other offices for that firm that are present on our residential panel are also approved.
View our Ltd Co panel
We will also assess whether a firm is suitable on a case by case basis if they are not already approved, and you should contact
legal@themortgagelender.com
to check whether the firm your client wishes to use qualifies.
If the firm is not experienced, then your client will be required to appoint an alternative firm or opt for separate representation. Should your client opt for separate representation we will still instruct our own legal firm to complete the conveyancing work on our behalf. Please note your client will be responsible for paying the fees of the firm chosen to advise us.
Our Conveyancing – Portal Keying Guide is available in the document section of our website to help select solicitors via our online portal.

Product Transfer
Product Transfer
If our customer, your client, is approaching the end of their initial fixed or tracker rate mortgage with us, or if they have already moved on to their reversion rate, one of the options you may choose to discuss with them is a Product Transfer.
Before your client’s initial fixed or tracker rate ends, we will send them a letter with details on how to switch using our Product Transfer service.
There are some eligibility requirements we need to check before we can consider your client’s request. You will also want to discuss your client’s personal situation and provide advice on the best option for them.
Eligibility requirements
The client’s current fixed or tracker rate is due to expire soon, or they are already on a variable rate (reversion rate).
The client is not moving home or looking to increase their mortgage balance
The client is not seeking to add or remove a party
The client must have no current arrears balance, and no missed payments in the last 12 months.
What to expect from our Product Transfer process
We will notify your client when it’s time
- If your client is currently on a variable rate, or they are coming to the end of their initial fixed or tracker rate, they will receive a letter from us that will explain their next steps.
Contacting your client
– We will recommend customers get in touch with their broker early so they can receive help to find the best option for their circumstances. We will confirm that the advice process will include a check to confirm if they are eligible to switch using a Product Transfer. You may wish to also proactively contact your clients to discuss their options.
Apply to Product Transfer
– If you recommend that your client should opt for a Product Transfer, and they meet our eligibility requirements, please log in to our origination portal and select the 'Product Switch' icon. You can then follow the portal steps using our handy 'How to Guide' – we also have our dedicated Product Transfer team available to answer your questions or support you and your client if the portal asks you to contact us. If your client decides to proceed with the Product Transfer, you complete this via the same portal.
Once a Product Transfer offer has been accepted the terms are locked in and it cannot be changed or cancelled without the customer/s incurring an early repayment charge

How do I know if my client can product transfer?
Your client will be made aware that a product transfer is a potential option for them by letter. The letter will advise them to speak to a professional mortgage intermediary for advice on the options available to them.
Can I switch clients that are already on SVR?
Yes, as long as your client meets the eligibility criteria.
Can clients add additional borrowing when doing a product transfer?
No, product transfers are like for like only. There is no option to change the outstanding loan amount.
How far in advance will clients receive notification?
All of our customers are notified of their current fixed-rate end date no less than 1 month out from expiry. They are directed to seek advice from a professional mortgage intermediary.

Valuations are HPI linked, and will have automatically calculated the LTV applicable.
Can clients change their mortgage term?
We do not accept term changes as part of the product transfer process.
What products are available for a product transfer?
You will be able to choose between a 2-year and 5-year fixed rate product for your client.

You can obtain a Pre-Offer Illustration via Sourcing Systems.
What documents does the client need to provide?
If your client meets the eligibility criteria, they will not be required to provide any supporting documentation.

Customer Outcome FAQs
Customer Outcome FAQs
Not for customer use. For professional intermediaries only.
When it comes to customer outcomes, we want to work with you, our intermediary partners, so we can grow together. That’s why we are always listening when you ask questions about customer outcomes, what it means for us as a lender and what it means for you.
Here you can find our Frequently Asked Questions.
How do we define a good customer outcome?
We define a good outcome as one where the customer receives a product that is designed to meet their needs, that provides fair value and helps them achieve their financial objective.  This can only be achieved by communicating and engaging with you and customers, your clients, in a way that helps them to make effective, timely and properly informed decisions.  We support customers to realise the benefits of the product without facing unreasonable barriers.
How do we issue information to intermediaries about the target markets for our products, and explain how our products provide fair value?
Information about the target markets for our products, and how they provide fair value, can be found
here
.
We understand the importance of this information being provided in a consistent format that is easily identifiable and understandable, therefore we have used a template created by a number of industry bodies working together – the Intermediary Mortgage Lenders Association (IMLA), UK Finance, the Building Societies Association and the Association of Mortgage Intermediaries (AMI). Our Product Information Sheets will be kept up to date with any changes to our proposition.
How are intermediary fees incorporated into our fair value assessments?
Intermediaries are responsible for ensuring their own fees and charges also represent fair value to their clients. We will provide you with the information you need to understand and communicate how our products and associated fees provide fair value to our target market.  This will include average intermediary fees.
How will we treat a customer if an intermediary discloses they have additional support requirements?
We will always treat any customer who has been identified as requiring additional support as an individual, fairly and appropriately.  We will communicate in a manner suitable to their circumstances and any communication needs they may have, ultimately ensuring they are generally supported in an appropriate manner.  We have identified as part of our target market that a proportion of our customers may have characteristics that require additional support.  Therefore, if we identify the support requirements, or you disclose them to us, we will record this and provide appropriate support that is required. This may include contacting the customer, you or both to check if additional information is required to aid understanding or find out if we need to change how and when we communicate.

COME TO THE WRONG PLACE?
