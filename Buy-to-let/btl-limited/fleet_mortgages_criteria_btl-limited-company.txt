#### About

We are Fleet Mortgages, a people-focused business specialising in buy-to-let lending.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


##### Our lending criteria

You ll find a snapshot of our buy-to-let lending criteria on this page. But if you can t find what you re looking for, or you re working on a more complex case and need some help, get in touch with our team.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


##### Loan Structure

We will take the first legal charge on a security, and we do not consent to second charges or do further advances.

If the property is leasehold and the applicant either has an interest in the freehold or has a connection to the freeholder, we will require a charge over the freehold as well as a first legal charge over the leasehold title. This will require the consent of other owners of the freehold, including those who may not be party to the mortgage over the leasehold interest.

Offers are valid for 90 days. (Up to 180 days for New Build Properties).

Fleet Mortgages reserves the right to ask the borrower to select a new rate if the case has not progressed to offer within 90 days of the application being submitted, which will also result in new credit checks being carried out.

We accept capital and interest repayment, part interest and part repayment and interest only repayment.

Minimum mortgage term is 5 years, and the maximum is 30 years (subject to the applicants age). We will potentially lend up to  5,000,000 per obligor with the first  1,000,000 at a maximum 80% LTV (subject to product availability) and then 75% thereafter.

We will accept purchase or remortgage applications and will consider capital raising for most legal purposes (except for paying tax and gambling debts). Payment of Inheritance Tax or Capital Gains Tax may be considered where the proposal does not suggest a position of financial stress for the applicants.

If the property has been owned for less than 6 months, we can consider lending on a case-by-case basis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


##### CoreLogic Buy to Let Hub

We work with CoreLogic to give our intermediary partners access to the Buy to Let Hub. This makes it quick and easy for you to submit details of your clients  property portfolio to us.

If you already have previous data stored within the hub you can use that information to create a new portfolio submission for Fleet Mortgages.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


###### 1. Existing Property Portfolio Schedule

Where all applicants, individually or collectively, own four or more existing mortgaged BTL properties, or three mortgaged properties where an application is being submitted to Fleet to purchase a fourth, we will request a property schedule that details the portfolio. Information is gathered via CoreLogic (Buy to Let Hub), allowing instant submission in real-time direct to our underwriters. Our underwriters will stress test the whole portfolio at 125% @ 5% with a maximum overall LTV of 75%.

You can enter the details of your client s property portfolio directly into a spreadsheet which you can download here. You can then upload the completed spreadsheet directly to the BTL Hub.

## Page 5 – The Loan (continued) and Portfolio Landlords

Fleet Mortgages can potentially lend up to five million pounds (£5,000,000) per obligor, at eighty percent (80%) loan-to-value (LTV) up to one million pounds (£1,000,000), and thereafter at seventy-five percent (75%) LTV.

From Friday 4th November 2022, Fleet Mortgages introduced a dedicated underwriting process for portfolio landlords.

When all applicants, either individually or collectively, own more than four existing mortgaged buy-to-let properties, or where three mortgaged properties already exist and an application is submitted to Fleet to purchase a fourth, a property schedule will be requested. This schedule must detail the portfolio, including all properties owned in the applicants’ sole names, joint names, and any owned in a company where the applicants are directors or shareholders. This schedule must also include any residential property on a consent-to-let agreement.

The information is gathered through CoreLogic’s Buy to Let Hub, allowing instant submission in real-time direct to Fleet’s underwriters. If data is already stored within the hub, it can be reused to create a new portfolio submission for Fleet Mortgages.

Fleet Mortgages has also introduced a Portfolio Landlords Questionnaire, which combines a simple business plan and cashflow forecast into an easy-to-complete document. Only existing landlords are required to complete this questionnaire, which is available in the Literature section of the website.

Please note the following points: there are no changes to the Decision in Principle (DIP) or application system. Portfolio applications will be assessed by dedicated underwriters. To minimise underwriting time, brokers are encouraged to upload the Portfolio Landlords Questionnaire via Fleet’s Broker Portal before submitting the CoreLogic property schedule.

Fleet Mortgages can potentially lend up to five million pounds (£5,000,000) per obligor, at eighty percent (80%) LTV up to one million pounds (£1,000,000), and thereafter at seventy-five percent (75%) LTV.

Monthly repayment is allowed only by Direct Debit.

Where a property is leasehold and the borrower either has an interest in the freehold or a connection to the freeholder, Fleet Mortgages will require a charge over the freehold in addition to a first legal charge over the leasehold title. This arrangement will require consent from other owners of the freehold, including those not party to the mortgage over the leasehold interest.

Documentary evidence of the source of the deposit is required, such as bank statements showing a build-up of savings or completion statements from a property sale. Gifts from immediate family members – spouse, mother, father, sibling, or grandparent – are allowed.

---

## Page 6 – The Loan (continued): Offer Validity and Remortgaging within 6 Months

Mortgage offers are valid for ninety (90) days, or up to one hundred and eighty (180) days for new build properties. Fleet Mortgages reserves the right to ask the borrower to select a new rate if a case has not progressed to offer within ninety (90) days of the application being submitted. This will also result in new credit checks being carried out.

Lending can be considered where a property has been owned for less than six months, on a case-by-case basis, if the following conditions are met: the Land Registry shows the borrower as the owner of the property; lending is against the original purchase price and the underwriter is satisfied with the original transaction, or substantial works have been carried out to justify an increase in value; evidence of how the applicant purchased the property (such as TR1 form and bank statements) is provided; and a copy of the TR1 or lease can be accepted at application stage, although the applicant must be registered as the proprietor at Land Registry before completion.

Fleet Mortgages will not consider lending where the applicant has owned the freehold of the security for less than six months and is splitting titles, or if there has been a sub-sale.

---

## Page 7 – The Applicant

The primary applicant must be a current property owner for at least twelve months. If the applicant does not currently own a property but has owned one within the last twelve months, subject to verification, the application may be considered.

First-time buyers are not accepted.

First-time landlords are accepted but subject to strict lending criteria and underwriting, with no exceptions permitted.

From Friday 4th November 2022, Fleet Mortgages introduced a dedicated underwriting process for portfolio landlords. When applicants own more than four mortgaged buy-to-let properties, or three mortgaged properties and are applying for a fourth, a full property schedule must be provided. This schedule includes all properties owned individually, jointly, or through a company where the applicants are directors or shareholders, including any residential property held on a consent-to-let basis.

The data is submitted via CoreLogic’s Buy to Let Hub for instant transfer to Fleet underwriters. Stored data may be reused to create a new submission.

A Portfolio Landlords Questionnaire, combining a business plan and cashflow forecast, must be completed by existing landlords. This questionnaire is available in the Literature section of Fleet’s website.

Please note that there are no changes to the Decision in Principle (DIP) or application system. Portfolio applications will be assessed by dedicated underwriters. To minimise underwriting time, brokers should upload the Portfolio Landlords Questionnaire through the Broker Portal before submitting the CoreLogic property schedule.

## Page 8 – The Applicant (continued)

Identity verification and anti-money laundering impersonation checks will be carried out.

Limited companies must be special purpose vehicles (SPVs) registered in England and Wales with one of the following SIC codes: 68100, 68209, 68320, or 68201. Holding companies can also have SIC codes 64209 or 64203. Multi-layered company structures can be considered.

For limited company applications, all directors and any shareholders with a holding of twenty-five percent (25%) or more must be party to the mortgage. Where the cumulative shareholding of these applicants is below seventy-five percent (75%), further shareholders will need to be added until a seventy-five percent (75%) shareholding is reached. Full personal guarantees will be obtained, and all guarantors will be required to take independent legal advice.

All directors, shareholders, or members party to the loan must be resident in the United Kingdom and have a full credit history in the UK.

Fleet Mortgages will consider applications where individuals are transferring or selling properties to an SPV limited company they own. This will be classed as a purchase. Full details are available in the Criteria Guide or from the sales team.

The minimum age for applicants is twenty-one (21) years. For first-time landlords the minimum age is twenty-five (25). The maximum age at the end of the mortgage term is ninety-five (95).

The primary applicant must be able to evidence income in excess of fifteen thousand pounds (£15,000) per annum. Reducing future income is unacceptable. All tax must be fully paid for the relevant year, and outstanding tax or tax being paid through an arrangement is not acceptable.

Fleet Mortgages will verify the income of the primary applicant through one of the following: the latest three months of payslips, the latest SA302 or Tax Calculation and Tax Overview from HMRC, the latest signed accounts, or the latest pension statement.

Up to three months of personal bank statements may be required at the discretion of the underwriter.

The primary applicant must meet one of the following employment status requirements. If employed, they must have been in continuous employment for at least twelve months and passed their probation period. If self-employed or a contractor, they must have been trading for at least two years in their current business. If retired, they must be receiving income in excess of fifteen thousand pounds (£15,000).

Excellent 👍 Let’s move on with **Pages 9–12**, rewritten word-for-word into paragraph style.

## Page 9 – The Applicant (continued)

All applicants must have been resident in the United Kingdom for at least three years. They must be liable to UK tax and must have permanent rights to reside, an indefinite right to remain card, or – if they are from the European Union (excluding Ireland) – they must have been granted settlement status. Tier 1 and Tier 2 visas are unacceptable.

All applicants must have a National Insurance number and a full credit history at their current, previous, or linked addresses for the last three years. Fleet Mortgages defines a full credit history as a three-year payment profile history at the current, previous, or linked addresses. The majority of their active credit must show at their current residential address, and this must include at least one active current account, credit card, loan, hire purchase, or mortgage.

Fleet Mortgages does not generally consider adverse credit. However, Fleet may consider the following: a County Court Judgment (CCJ) or default up to two hundred and fifty pounds (£250) that is unsatisfied within the last three years; a CCJ or default up to five hundred pounds (£500) that is satisfied within the last three years; or a credit file (whether secured or unsecured loan, hire purchase, current account, or credit card) that has been up to two payments in arrears at any point in the last three years. Mortgage arrears are only acceptable if the account is not currently in arrears, and there must not have been more than two months in arrears in the last three years.

This applies whether the adverse is registered against the applicant or applicants as individuals, or if it is registered against any limited company of which they are currently, or were at the time of the adverse credit, a director or shareholder.

Fleet Mortgages will not consider any applicants who currently have, or who within the last six years have had, a petition or declaration of bankruptcy against them. Where Fleet Mortgages becomes aware that an applicant is a director or shareholder of a company that has gone into, or is due to go into, Creditors’ Voluntary Liquidation or Compulsory Liquidation, Fleet will not lend.

A full consumer and, where applicable, limited company credit search will be completed on all applicants.

---

## Page 10 – The Property

The property must be located in England or Wales.

A full valuation instructed by Fleet Mortgages is required on all properties. The property value will be assessed using comparable evidence, not rental yield or rent multiplication. Properties must be valued between fifty thousand pounds (£50,000) and five million pounds (£5,000,000). Valuations are valid for one hundred and eighty (180) days from the date of inspection. In some exceptional circumstances, Fleet may require a second audit valuation at no additional cost to the borrower.

Properties must be freehold or leasehold. Commonhold tenure is not accepted. Leasehold properties must have at least seventy-five (75) years remaining at the point of completion, with a minimum of fifty (50) years unexpired at the expiry of the mortgage term.

All properties must have a valid Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) with a rating between A and E. A valid EPC certificate must be provided before the mortgage offer is issued, and it must still be valid at completion. Properties with an EPC rating of A, B, or C will be eligible for one of Fleet’s EPC A-C products.

Sustainable rental income for twelve months must be confirmed through valuation only.

The rent cover requirements are available in the product guide.

Acceptable tenancies include assured shorthold tenancies (AST) of up to three years, student lets, corporate lets (with prior approval), and local authority or housing association lets (with prior approval). The standard format of a Private Sector Lease, as set out in the UK Finance Mortgage Lenders’ Handbook, is also acceptable.

Acceptable security includes flats in blocks of up to five storeys, or up to ten storeys where the property is within the M25. Blocks of flats with more than four storeys (excluding basement floors but including ground floor) must have lift access to all floors to be acceptable.

Fleet Mortgages will consider residential property for remortgage at market value within the first six months of ownership where it can be evidenced that significant improvements have been made.

Shared houses with a maximum of four people sharing are acceptable on a standard mortgage product, provided that the property is not an HMO under Fleet’s definition, has a standard layout that would sell as a family home without alteration, has at least one communal room that will be maintained and valued as such, can be sold as a single residential unit, and is let on a furnished basis.

Properties with up to six bedrooms are acceptable. The gross internal floor area must be in excess of thirty square metres (30sqm).

Standard construction types are acceptable. For Fleet’s definition of non-standard construction types, applicants must refer to the list of unacceptable properties.

---

## Page 11 – The Property (continued)

New builds are defined as properties constructed or converted within the last twelve months, or properties that have never been occupied. Up to seventy percent (70%) LTV is available on new build flats, and up to seventy-five percent (75%) LTV on new build houses.

Converted freehold properties must have a minimum valuation of one hundred thousand pounds (£100,000) outside London and the South East, or one hundred and fifty thousand pounds (£150,000) within London and the South East.
