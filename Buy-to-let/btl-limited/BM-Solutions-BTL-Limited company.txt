────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


## Customer

All directors and shareholders must be fully and properly identified as part of the mortgage application process.

Accurate information must be recorded on our application system, including confirmation of whether this is a face-to-face or non-face-to-face application.

If the director or shareholder doesn't pass our electronic verification checks, you'll need to certify and retain evidence of the identification documents.

The documents you can accept depend on whether you've met with the directors and shareholders in person, or remotely by telephone or video.

Here's a guide to understanding what documents you'll need.

For face-to-face verification, where the directors and shareholders are physically present and documentation is taken and verified, one document from the single identification list can be used to verify the directors and shareholders.

Single ID can't be used if the directors and shareholders aren't present when ID&V is collected. This includes video interviews. In this case, use the standard ID&V process.

These documents can be accepted in a former name with evidence of the name change, such as a marriage certificate, Deed Poll or Decree Absolute.

Standard ID&V must be followed when the directors and shareholders aren't present when ID&V is obtained, or the directors/shareholders doesn't have a single ID document.

The directors and shareholders will need to produce two separate documents. These must be originals and can only be used once in the process for either address verification or identification.

FCA registered firms must make sure any documentation relied upon to verify the directors and shareholders identity is copied, certified, and retained in accordance with money laundering regulations. We reserve the right to contact you and request copies of identity documents at any time during the life of the mortgage and for up to five years after cessation.

• The directors or shareholders (or at least one director or stakeholder on a joint or multiple application) have lived continuously in the UK for more than 5 years.
• To determine if directors or shareholders have lived in the UK for more than five years we will use data provided by credit reference agencies.

Only identification and address verification and right to reside documents need to be certified.

You must certify the documents when they're collected and keep copies on file. You don't need to upload copies to the application unless we ask you to.

Documents must be certified by an FCA-registered mortgage intermediary. Certification should include:

The certifier must also add written confirmation on the document. Suggested wording for this is:

'I certify this is a true and correct copy of the original document as sighted by me'. You can use your own variation of this if you prefer.

## Income

Affordability is assessed using the anticipated rental income from the property. We'll also assess personal income when making a lending decision, so it's important the directors and shareholders income is keyed accurately as it might affect the decision.

When doing this, we expect to see the directors and shareholders can afford their personal commitments, so we can be confident our lending decision is sustainable if the tenant stops paying or the property needs any maintenance or repairs. An application might be declined if our assessment shows there's not enough disposable income to support the borrowing and the directors and shareholders personal commitments.

In our rental cover calculation, we want the directors and shareholders to have more rent coming in than the normal mortgage payment, so the situations mentioned earlier can be covered.

We'll also take the additional cost of increased tax liability for directors or shareholders into account.

We understand personal income might not fully reflect the overall financial picture for the directors and shareholders. They could have other assets and savings, for example. We also know the buy to let might be in a single name, but personal financial commitments could be held jointly with someone else.

Tax on rental income

Income types

• How the directors and shareholders manage their commitments.
• How they've built up any reserves, including the deposit.
• Whether they have previous experience of buying to let.
• The rationale for sole director, where finances are joint.
• Business details for self-employed directors and shareholders.

Foreign currency income is any income other than sterling received by directors or shareholders. Foreign currency income paid into a UK bank account and transferred to sterling is still considered to be foreign currency.

Foreign currency income won't be accepted for new mortgage or remortgage applications for new and existing directors or shareholders, including porting, transfers of mortgaged property (TOMP), and further advances.

The only exceptions to this are further advance applications for essential repairs to the mortgaged property and product transfers.

If your directors or shareholders are classed as employed, they'll need to have been in their current role for at least three months.

If your directors or shareholders are classed as self-employed, we'll need at least two years' worth of trading figures.

We'll consider applications from these directors and shareholders if they have continuous employment of 12 months or more with six months of the contract remaining, or the directors and shareholders have two years' continuous service in the same type of employment. Evidence of their employment record might be needed.

For IT contractors on any income and other contractors whose income is more than  500 per day or  75,000 per annum, whether employed or self-employed, we accept the gross value of the contract as evidence of income. All directors and shareholders must have a current continuous employment of 12 months or more with six months of the contract remaining or two years continuous service in the same type of employment.

The directors and shareholders should be treated as self-employed if they have more than one contract, or where they've set up a limited company and employ other contractors.

For these directors and shareholders, they'll need to provide an average of their latest 3 months income. They should be treated as self-employed if they pay their own tax or sub-contract to more than one company.

Applications from directors and shareholders employed on a zero-hours contract will be considered. We'll only take income from the total of the last 12 calendar months into account income. Directors and shareholders will have to verify their income.

Professional sports people will have to confirm they've either been in continuous employment for 12 months or more with six months of the contract remaining, or two years' continuous service as at the date of application in the same type of employment.

It's essential to verify these directors and shareholders will be able to meet their monthly repayments as they near the end of their career or if their career's ended early because of injury.

Length of employment/self-employment

Income types

Self-employed directors and share holders

For all applications, at least one of the directors or shareholders needs to have an earned income and/or pension income. All income sources must be recorded accurately. This includes all full years of self-employed income, PAYE, pension income, and all gross monthly rental. All income sources need to be within the UK.

For employed, self-employed, and retired directors and shareholders, all rental income and finance costs captured in the 'Land and property income' section of the application should match the directors and shareholders tax calculations from HMRC. You can find how to key this in our Hints & tips PDF (3.1MB).

Select 'Occupation type' as 'Professional' and 'Employment type' as 'Self-Employed'.

You'll need to input a year end date and figures for their most recent and previous years. The most recent date can't be older than 18 months from the date of submission.

The remaining figures for net profit, turnover, gross profit, current assets, and current liabilities must be input as ' 0'. Complete the 'Self-employment details' - including business name and accountant details - and the 'Add employment' section. The land and property profit figures from the tax calculation will then need to be entered into the land and property income section.

Any finance costs for the latest year will also need to be entered. The finance costs are referenced at the bottom of the tax calculation, as well on the individual's self-assessment tax return, and property income supplement (SA105).

For 'Can income be verified?', you must answer 'Yes'.

The current rental amount of the property should be keyed on the application as the current monthly rent paid by the tenant.

The current rental amount keyed will be the anticipated monthly rent of the property.

The gross monthly rent will need to be keyed into the property schedule screen for all buy to let properties owned by any directors and shareholders named on the application.

A tenancy agreement or letter from the letting agent can be used to verify the rental income keyed in the Property schedule screen.

If any director or shareholder has more than one job, we'll consider the following to decide if we can take the secondary income into account.

You should key the highest income as the directors and shareholders main income, and the income from the second job as additional employment.

• Are the hours/days worked sustainable?
• Are the roles/skills similar?
• What's the distance between the jobs and the directors or shareholders home?
• How long has the directors or shareholders been in both jobs?
• Is the salary consistent with the type of employment?

Self-employed directors and shareholders must have been self-employed for a minimum of 2 years and be able to provide at least 2 years' worth of trading figures.

All self-employed income must be entered in the 'Net profit' field, except profit from UK Land & Property, which needs to be captured in the Land and property income section.

The tax due figure on the tax calculation and tax year overview will usually match. If there is a difference in the tax figure, we might need updated documents.

The latest two years' full accounts must be finalised and clearly show the net profit for sole traders, the share of net profit for partnerships, or salary and dividends for directors of limited companies.

Profit and loss statements alone aren't acceptable.

The year end for all documents must be the most recent and not be dated more than 18 months before the date of application.

Finance costs are not tax deductible, but tax relief can be claimed at the basic rate, whatever rate of tax the director or shareholder pays. This will mean an increased tax liability for some landlords. Where applications are referred for manual review, we'll consider the additional tax liability.

Directors or shareholders must get independent tax advice if they're unsure how the tax rules will affect them.

## Lending

Assignable contracts allow the original buyer to sell the property before legal completion, by assigning the contract to buy the property to a new buyer after contracts have been exchanged with the developer.

We can't accept applications involving assignable contracts or irrevocable powers of attorney in favour of intervening sellers. Any similar transaction structure must be reported to us.

New build

You must answer 'Yes' to the credit history question asking if any director or shareholder has had a bankruptcy / IVA / debt management arrangement or debt relief order which was:

Or

If a bankruptcy / IVA / debt management arrangement or debt relief order was registered over six years ago and is no longer outstanding, the question can be answered as 'No'.

County Court Judgements (CCJs)

Mortgage arrears

• Registered within the last six years (whether now completed or not).

• Is still outstanding (whenever this was registered).

We do not offer Limited company consumer buy to let (CBTL), all Limited company buy to lets are business buy to let (BBTL).

We don't accept concessionary purchase applications where the property is being purchased below full market value.

The only exception to this is the purchase of a new build property if the value has increased between agreement to purchase and building completion. Builder incentives are acceptable, subject to our existing criteria.

It's acceptable to purchase a BTL property from a director or shareholders family member, as long as the deposit is sourced from the directors or shareholders own resources and the property is purchased at full market value. We can't accept gifted deposits, even if they're from a different family member to the directors or shareholders.

Limited company BTL properties cannot be let to a family member.

Gift of equity is accepted when the property is being purchased from director or shareholder

Builder cash incentives

Please answer 'Yes' to the credit history question if any directors or shareholders have had a County Court Judgement (CCJ) or default registered against them, or their business if they're self-employed, within the last six years.

CCJs are generally considered in credit scoring. Background details will be need for the application.

Mortgage arrears

Bankruptcies

All applications will be credit scored. Directors or shareholders have the right to appeal if an application is declined because it doesn't pass our credit scoring.

Here are the scenarios when an appeal might be successful:

The directors or shareholders is in the British Armed Forces and living at a BFPO address.

The fraud's been reported to the police and Credit Industry Fraud Avoidance system (CIFAS) and has its own a crime reference number.

If the adverse information has been registered on a non-Lloyds Banking Group product, an appeal can't be submitted. The directors or shareholders should arrange for their credit file to be corrected before a new application is submitted.

For any scenario outside of these, it's unlikely we'll change our decision.

Read our credit scoring guide

A dependant is anyone who relies on your directors or shareholders financially. They won't be included on the mortgage or contribute to the monthly payments.

Child and adult dependants need to be captured separately.

These are any children under 18 who the directors or shareholders are the primary carer for. You should also include any children they're expecting or in the process of adopting. Foster children or any children who have an income they can fully support themselves with don't need to be included.

Child maintenance must be keyed as an outgoing commitment, but the child doesn't need to be included as a dependant.

An adult dependant is someone not included in the mortgage but is financially reliant on the directors or shareholders. This could be a spouse/partner, elderly relative, or any grown-up children in full-time education or unemployed.

If the adult dependant doesn't live at the property all of the time, still key this in the adult dependant section.

If the adult dependant doesn't ever live at the property, they must not be keyed as a dependant, but the related costs must be keyed as a total figure in 'Other commitments'.

The source of all director and shareholder deposits must be captured, and proof must be retained for all buy to let applications, other than remortgages.

The deposit should come from the directors and shareholders own resources. A builder's deposit of up to 5% of the purchase price is allowable on new build property applications if the LTV is 75% or less. The valuer must be aware of any incentive and make a note of it in the valuation report.

For certain applications, you'll need to verify the deposit. Evidence will also be needed if the application needs an underwriter review, and/or a message is displayed at DIP submission and the additional requirements section of the Submit application results screens at full application.

If the directors and shareholders are remortgaging or taking a further advance on an existing property with us, and the funds will be used as a deposit, we'll need to view the funds in an account or an offer guaranteeing the lending.

Gifted deposits from directors or shareholders to the Limited company are acceptable

Gift of equity accepted when the property is being purchased from director or shareholder

Gifted deposits from family to directors or shareholders are acceptable. They must be non-repayable. The property can't be let out to, or purchased from, a family member. Evidence of the source of deposit must be kept on record in all cases.

Purchases between family members are acceptable, as long as the property's sold at market value and the buyer is a UK resident.

You'll need to provide a signed letter written by the donor within three months of the mortgage application

You must also provide the latest UK bank statement or passbook showing evidence of the deposit funds in the donor's or directors or shareholders UK bank account. Alternatively, a letter from the donor's or directors or shareholders UK bank confirming the funds are available can be provided.

Additional statements or other documents can be requested if needed.

View our gifted deposit letter template

A family member is someone who is related to at least one of the directors or shareholders:

Auntie/Uncle (related by blood)

Niece/Nephew

We may request up-to-date UK bank statements or a passbook showing evidence of the inheritance, if needed.

A portfolio landlord application is where the directors and shareholders have four or more mortgaged BTL properties, including the new transaction. This is based on the total number held by everyone named on the application.

Two directors and shareholders are buying a property together. Director 1 already has two mortgaged BTL properties, and director 2 has one mortgaged BTL property.

In total, they'll have four properties between them, including the one they're buying together, so the application is classified as a portfolio landlord.

Mortgaged BTL properties include those held in a personal name, limited company name, or any other legal entity.

Your application will not progress until all of the above has been fully completed - including completion of the portfolio details screen in the full application.

* Based on the entire portfolio, including acquiring property and any unencumbered let property.

These aren't included in the total mortgaged BTL properties. But the rent and property value must be declared in the property schedule and portfolio details sections of the application.

Since 06 April 2020, tax relief on finance costs for landlords of residential properties is restricted to basic rate of income tax, regardless of which tax band the landlord falls into. Accordingly, profit from land and property as it appears on a tax calculation no longer has finance costs deducted.

You'll need to input the latest year's finance costs on the application.

If you need any help with an application, get in touch with our specialist team. You'll get your own dedicated case handler, who will contact you once you submit your application.

## Property

Properties must be in England, Scotland or Wales. Applications for properties in Northern Ireland are unacceptable.

Examples of builder cash incentives include deposit contributions, cash-backs, contribution to legal fees/stamp duty, and mortgage subsidies.

Builder cash incentives are usually acceptable if their value isn't more than 5% of the lower of the purchase price or valuation. Cash incentives more than this might mean a lower maximum loan amount is available.

All builder cash incentives must be declared at the point of sale. All lending decisions are based on either the valuation or purchase price, whichever is lower.

New build

The buy to let property address must not be the same as the directors or shareholders correspondence address.

Properties in buildings five storeys or higher no longer need an External Wall System (EWS1) form in order to progress an application. We'll also consider applications on properties where cladding remediation work is needed but not yet completed.

EWS1 forms might still be needed for buildings four storeys or lower. The surveyor will advise when an External Wall System (EWS1) form is required to confirm the status of the external wall system and any applicable attachments e.g. balconies on multi occupied, multi storey buildings of any height.

Will still need an EWS1 form regardless of height. Directors or shareholders will have to source the EWS1 form themselves.

The building owner and/or agent is responsible for confirming an external wall system or attachments, such as a balcony, on buildings containing flats has been assessed by a suitable expert.

The EWS1 form must be prepared by a qualified independent professional. They must be a member of one of the professional bodies listed by RICS.

We can't confirm if a property is acceptable until a valuation has been instructed.

For purchase cases, a special condition will be added to the mortgage offer to instruct the conveyancer to advise the directors or shareholders an offer has been made based on the information in an EWS1. It'll also make sure the directors or shareholders know neither us nor the surveyor are liable for information in the EWS1 form.

In England and Wales, The Building (Amendment) Regulations 2018 or local equivalent can be used for new builds over six storeys or 18 metres high. A conveyancer will need to confirm this has been used by the building owner or agent.

This applies to new builds of four storeys or 11 metres high in Scotland.

If this can't be confirmed, please follow the EWS1 process.

The property must be habitable, readily lettable or saleable, and structurally sound.

Buildings insurance also needs to be able to be arranged on it.

For details of our what we need where a property has been converted into flats or is part of a purpose-built block, see Tenure of flats.

The property must be in the UK under UK legal jurisdiction. Property acceptability is based on a satisfactory valuation report from the bank's appointed valuer.

Non-standard construction will be assessed on individual merit.

Certain types of pre-cast reinforced concrete (PRC) construction are classed as defective. We might not accept it unless it's been repaired.

We'll be guided by the suitability of all mortgage properties by the valuer.

• Adjoining property purchases are acceptable, subject to valuer's comments.
• Houseboats and mobile homes/park homes aren't acceptable.
• Properties with annexes are acceptable as long as the annexe forms part of the main title. There should also be no separate tenancy agreement in place for the annexe.
• Studio flats are acceptable subject to valuer's comments. There is no minimum size requirement.
• Right to Buy/Shared ownership applications aren't acceptable.
• If a flat is part of a conversion, where the total number of flats in the scheme is above eight, the valuer must confirm the whole conversion project has been or will be completed to a high standard.
• Flats above/next to a business owned by the same person aren't acceptable.
• Flats above/next to a business not owned by the same person are subject to valuer's comments.

Applications involving a distressed sale, or a sale and leaseback aren't acceptable.

An energy performance certificate (EPC) gives domestic properties an energy-efficiency rating from A to G. The EPC is valid for 10 years. If the property is sold in that time, the EPC can be used by the new owner.

• Properties in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales must have a valid EPC rating of E or above.
• Purchase, remortgage, and Let to Buy applications on properties with F or G EPC ratings are only allowed where a registered exemption is in place.
• We do not accept further advance applications where the EPC rating is F, G or an exemption is in place, except when the purpose of loan is for BTL repairs.
• Product transfers are exempt.
• For new build properties, use the Predicted Energy Assessment (PEA) or Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP) rating if no EPC is available.
• If a property is exempt, evidence isn't needed unless we request it.
• Evidence of EPC, PEA, SAP, or exemption evidence should be kept on file.

When a site is assessed as suitable for lending, we'll no longer apply an initial cap on our lending exposure. We'll continue to monitor applications (exposure) as the development progresses and might restrict further lending if concerns arise.

There might be a small number of sites where we decide not to lend on because of specific market or site conditions.

If a free valuation is selected as part of a product incentive, the appeal process on the property valuation isn't available.

If you want to appeal the rental valuation on a BTL remortgage application, please contact us.

Properties subject to Local Authority Homes in Multiple Occupation (HMO) licensing might be acceptable, subject to the valuer's assessment of suitability based on our requirements:

Letting criteria

• The maximum number of unrelated tenants is five. They must all be named on the agreement. It's the landlords' responsibility to make sure all legislation is complied with, including (but not restricted to) legislation relating to Tenancy Deposit schemes and HMOs.
• The property must be suitable for standard residential occupation.
• Institutional type properties, for example hostel accommodation/bedsits/shared accommodation comparable to halls of residence, aren't acceptable.
• For larger properties, where there is a potential of more than five lettable rooms, the valuer must be satisfied the property and local market reflects single family letting arrangements.
• The property can be let on a single assured shorthold tenancy in England and Wales, or a private residential tenancy in Scotland.

We'll lend if the valuer confirms the property is suitable mortgage security and provides a present condition valuation figure.

To assess the property, the valuer will need a report outlining the issues and a quote from a treatment company. The company must either be a member of the Property Care Association or offer a warranty-backed treatment plan. If treatment is needed, it's often over 3-4 years.

An initial occupancy/new build property is classed as any property being occupied and/or sold for the first time on the open market in its current state. It also includes newly converted and refurbished properties. These will fall into one of the following categories:

The property must have a Building Standards Indemnity Scheme from a warranty provider accepted by Lloyds Banking Group:

• Newly built property.
• Refurbished property. These are usually as initial occupancy where the vendor is a builder/developer and the property has been vacated, so it can be refurbished.
• Newly converted property. An example of this is a barn or warehouse converted into residential flats or houses.
• A property, either new or converted, that's been tenanted and is now offered for sale for the first time on the open market by the builder/developer.

• ABC+.
• Advantage HCI.
• ARK Insurance.
• Building LifePlans Ltd (BLP).
• Buildzone.
• Checkmate.
• Global Home Warranties.
• HomeProof (previously Aedis).
• International Construction Warranties (ICW).
• NHBC.
• One Guarantee.
• Premier Guarantee - includes the LABC New Homes Warranty and LABC Hallmark.
• Protek.
• Q Assure.

• A single detached property - either self-built or otherwise - where construction is monitored by a consultant employed directly by the directors or shareholders.
• A property built by a self-build group, where construction is monitored by a consultant employed by that self-build group.
• A property forming part of a small, solely residential development of not more than 15 units in total, where construction is monitored by a consultant employed by the builder or developer. If flats/maisonettes are involved, each individual flat/maisonette counts as one property. Developments containing more than 15 units need an acceptable form of building standards indemnity.

If the purchase property address changes once a mortgage application has been made, and the Limited company's original mortgage product has been withdrawn, a new deal from the current range must be selected.

If the property being purchased isn't changing but an amendment is needed to the address keyed, such as the property number or street name, this must be changed by us before completion. Please contact us to make this change.

We can no longer accept re-type/transcription reports from a Generic Mortgage Valuation Report (GMVR) with a valid Home Report.

For further clarification, please contact your BDM

Sub-sales and back-to-back transactions aren't acceptable.

The current vendor must have owned the property for at least six months before we can accept an application to purchase the property.

We use the date of registration at the Land Registry to work out the length of ownership.

A back-to-back transaction is a type of sub-sale where the intervening seller buys from the original seller and sells on to the borrower on the same day or within a few days. We also class cases where the seller acquires the freehold - or superior leasehold - title to the property, and immediately sells on to the borrower by grant of lease or sub-lease as sub-sales.

The conveyancer will be responsible for making sure the application meets the acceptable criteria.

Applications involving assignable contracts or irrevocable powers of attorney in favour of intervening sellers aren't acceptable. You should tell us about any other transaction structure with a similar effect.

• a personal representative of the registered proprietor,
• an institutional mortgagee exercising its power of sale,
• a receiver, trustee-in-bankruptcy or liquidator,
• a developer or builder selling a property acquired under a part-exchange scheme,
• a registered housing provider or housing association exercising a power of sale.

Freehold and leasehold houses are acceptable. Leasehold properties must have a minimum of 70 years left on the lease at application.

If a property's been converted into no more than four units or is within a purpose-built block, any leases should already be in place and not created at the same time as the mortgage application.

We'll consider lending in these situations:

• The conveyancer will make sure the lease meets our standard requirements.

• Our charge must be registered on the freehold of the whole building and the leasehold interest of the unit. The conveyancer will make sure the lease meets our standard requirements.
• The mortgage must be in the same name as the freehold and leasehold titles.
• It's only acceptable for the Limited company to own one unit in the whole building, including any new application.

• Our charge must be registered on the leasehold interest only. The conveyancer will make sure the lease meets our standard requirements.
• It's only acceptable for the Limited company to own one unit in the whole building, including any new application.

• The security will be registered on the freehold of the whole building and processed as a freehold house.
• The Limited company must own the freehold in their own name.
• The mortgage and freehold title must be in the same name. It's not acceptable to hold the freehold in a Limited Company with the customer as sole director, majority shareholder, or with any family member.
• All units other than the freehold unit on which we're lending must have a minimum lease of 70 years.
• It's only acceptable for the Limited company to own one unit in the whole building, including any new applications.

• Tenure must be leasehold.
• A management company must be in place.
• The Limited company can hold a share in the management company.
• The conveyancer will make sure arrangements in connection with the management company are acceptable.
• Our mortgage must be registered on the leasehold title.

• Timber or metal framed buildings where the cavity has been retrospectively filled with an insulation material.
• Concrete walls built in Cornwall or Devon before 1950. Or 1960 for postcodes PL12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 22, and 23, where a valuer has recommended a Mundic report, and a concrete test has classified it as class B or C.
• Unrepaired, designated defective properties under the Housing Act 1985, Housing (Scotland) Act 1987, Housing (Northern Ireland) Order 1986.
• Large panel system type lats or maisonette blocks without an acceptable structural appraisal.
• Load bearing panels made of asbestos or gypsum plaster.
• Structurally unsound or uninsurable properties.

• A dwelling on a single title must not be split into separate units of accommodation, such as a house converted into two flats, so each flat would need its own title.
• property purchased from and let to the same family member.
• Bedsits.
• Commercial property.
• Ex-local authority flats, unless the majority of the building is owner-occupied.
• Farms or property with land subject to commercial agricultural use.
• Live/work units.
• Mobile homes/houseboats.
• Property assessed as unsuitable security by the valuer.
• Property with restricted occupancy.
• Property designated defective under the Housing Defects Act 1984.
• Properties where buildings insurance can't be arranged.
• Right to Buy/Shared ownership applications.
• Timeshares.
• Properties with an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) rating of F or G with no registered exemption in place.

The minimum acceptable property value or purchase price is  50,000 - whichever is the lower.

A mortgage valuation is valid for 12 months. If a mortgage doesn't complete within 12 months of the valuation being carried out, a new valuation will be needed. We'll advise you if a new valuation fee is also needed.

## Existing customer

Standalone product transfers can be processed as soon as the account is up to date without the need to wait three months.

Some of our products have early repayment charges (ERCs). These will apply if your directors and shareholders repays some or all of their mortgage in the ERC period.

For mortgage products with ERCs, up to 10% of the amount outstanding can be repaid without having to pay an ERC. We can change or withdraw this at any time.

On a porting application, any ERC, which might apply will be waived or refunded if the ERC period ends in the next three months.

On a product transfer application, any ERC which might apply will be waived or refunded if the ERC period ends in the next four months.

You can't start a product transfer application more than four months before the ERC period ends.

If the account has multiple sub-accounts with different ERC periods, you can only complete a product transfer application on the sub-account with the ERC expiring the soonest.

Once the application has been submitted and the new product has started, you'll be able to apply for a product transfer on the other sub-accounts. Instead, you can wait until the ERC on all sub-accounts have three months left until expiry and apply for a product transfer application on all eligible sub-accounts.

For product transfers and further advances, ERCs will be charged on any overpayments made over the 10%, even if the customer is within four months of the ERC expiry.

We currently do not allow further lending for Limited company mortgages.

Making Overpayments | Knowledge Base | Birmingham Midshires

One-off or regular overpayments can be made at any time. If early repayment charges (ERCs) apply to the product, please refer to our ERC section for more details.

Payment holidays aren't allowed.

Any early repayment charges (ERCs) won't have to be paid on existing BTL mortgage products ported to a new application.

If a product is portable, it will be outlined in the original mortgage offer and supporting documentation. You can't port a product to a remortgage application if the property is currently mortgaged. You can port to a remortgage of an unencumbered (mortgage free) property the director or shareholder already owns or a new purchase.

Porting to an unencumbered remortgage can only be done using the 'Remortgage own conveyancer' option. You can't select our free legal service.

Where a new application is submitted before redemption of the current mortgage, the product can be ported.

For more information, please refer to our porting guide.

• a new mortgage is being taken in the last three months of the ERC period of the current product.
• you apply for a new application on a new product within three months of an existing BM BTL mortgage being redeemed.

Product transfers are available for Limited company mortgages at the end of the product period.

Once a product transfer's been submitted, an automated eligibility check will be carried out to make sure the mortgage qualifies. If the mortgage doesn't pass the eligibility check, you'll see an on-screen message explaining the reason why and what to do next.

• The account is a regulated mortgage.
• The account is in arrears.
• The account has multiple Direct Debits.
• The account has a payment arrangement in place.
• The tenure of the property information is missing from the account.
• No sub-accounts are available to transfer.
• The account requires a review of the sub-account balances.

Product transfers can be submitted at any time in the month. The earliest a product transfer can start is the 1st of the following month.

If the mortgage is within the last three months of an existing product, you can choose to start the new product early. If you select this option, we'll waive any early repayment charge (ERC). You can also choose to forward date the new product to start after the current product has ended.

If the account has multiple sub-accounts with different ERC periods, you can only complete a product transfer application on the sub-account with the ERC expiring the soonest.

When the mortgage is within the last 4 months of an existing product, you can choose to select a new product and forward date the new product to start after the current product has ended.

#### Single ID&V

For face-to-face verification, where the directors and shareholders are physically present and documentation is taken and verified, one document from the single identification list can be used to verify the directors and shareholders.

Single ID can't be used if the directors and shareholders aren't present when ID&V is collected. This includes video interviews. In this case, use the standard ID&V process.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


#### Standard ID&V

Standard ID&V must be followed when the directors and shareholders aren't present when ID&V is obtained, or the directors/shareholders doesn't have a single ID document.

The directors and shareholders will need to produce two separate documents. These must be originals and can only be used once in the process for either address verification or identification.

FCA registered firms must make sure any documentation relied upon to verify the directors and shareholders identity is copied, certified, and retained in accordance with money laundering regulations. We reserve the right to contact you and request copies of identity documents at any time during the life of the mortgage and for up to five years after cessation.

#### Certifying documents

Documents must be certified by an FCA-registered mortgage intermediary. Certification should include:

• Certifier's signature, name, and job title.
• The date of certification, which must be within three months of the application date.

The certifier must also add written confirmation on the document. Suggested wording for this is:

'I certify this is a true and correct copy of the original document as sighted by me'. You can use your own variation of this if you prefer.

Separate 'certificates' are acceptable. These are sometimes called ID verification header sheets, broker/adviser verification checklists or similar.

• Details on the certificate must match those of the ID&V documents provided.
• Wording to confirm true and correct copies of documents should be included.
• The intermediary name and signature must be included on the certificate/document and the date must be within three months of the application date.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


#### Some of the information we might need to manually underwrite an application, includes:

• How the directors and shareholders manage their commitments.
• How they've built up any reserves, including the deposit.
• Whether they have previous experience of buying to let.
• The rationale for sole director, where finances are joint.
• Business details for self-employed directors and shareholders.

#### Sub-contractors, fixed/short term contracts, and agency workers

We'll consider applications from these directors and shareholders if they have continuous employment of 12 months or more with six months of the contract remaining, or the directors and shareholders have two years' continuous service in the same type of employment. Evidence of their employment record might be needed.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


#### IT and other contractors

For IT contractors on any income and other contractors whose income is more than  500 per day or  75,000 per annum, whether employed or self-employed, we accept the gross value of the contract as evidence of income. All directors and shareholders must have a current continuous employment of 12 months or more with six months of the contract remaining or two years continuous service in the same type of employment.

The directors and shareholders should be treated as self-employed if they have more than one contract, or where they've set up a limited company and employ other contractors.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


#### Construction Industry Scheme Contractors (CIS)

For these directors and shareholders, they'll need to provide an average of their latest 3 months income. They should be treated as self-employed if they pay their own tax or sub-contract to more than one company.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


#### Zero-hours contracts

Applications from directors and shareholders employed on a zero-hours contract will be considered. We'll only take income from the total of the last 12 calendar months into account income. Directors and shareholders will have to verify their income.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


#### Professional sports people

Professional sports people will have to confirm they've either been in continuous employment for 12 months or more with six months of the contract remaining, or two years' continuous service as at the date of application in the same type of employment.

It's essential to verify these directors and shareholders will be able to meet their monthly repayments as they near the end of their career or if their career's ended early because of injury.

#### To key a directors or shareholders whose only source of income is from land and property

Select 'Occupation type' as 'Professional' and 'Employment type' as 'Self-Employed'.

You'll need to input a year end date and figures for their most recent and previous years. The most recent date can't be older than 18 months from the date of submission.

The remaining figures for net profit, turnover, gross profit, current assets, and current liabilities must be input as ' 0'. Complete the 'Self-employment details' - including business name and accountant details - and the 'Add employment' section. The land and property profit figures from the tax calculation will then need to be entered into the land and property income section.

Any finance costs for the latest year will also need to be entered. The finance costs are referenced at the bottom of the tax calculation, as well on the individual's self-assessment tax return, and property income supplement (SA105).

For 'Can income be verified?', you must answer 'Yes'.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


#### For all remortgages and further advances

The current rental amount of the property should be keyed on the application as the current monthly rent paid by the tenant.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


#### For a buy to let purchase

The current rental amount keyed will be the anticipated monthly rent of the property.

The gross monthly rent will need to be keyed into the property schedule screen for all buy to let properties owned by any directors and shareholders named on the application.

A tenancy agreement or letter from the letting agent can be used to verify the rental income keyed in the Property schedule screen.

#### If any of the following applies, the director or shareholder must be keyed as self-employed:

• They have a shareholding of 25% or more.
• If directors or shareholders both own a percentage share of 25% or more between them, treat them both as self-employed.
• A sub-contractor who earns income from more than one contract.
• They have a partnership interest in a business where income is not PAYE, regardless of the percentage shareholding.
• They own a franchise.
• They're employed by a private limited company (LTD) and receive a salary (PAYE) and dividends as part of their remuneration package.
• They're in a limited liability partnership (LLP) and receive a share of net profits.

All self-employed income must be entered in the 'Net profit' field, except profit from UK Land & Property, which needs to be captured in the Land and property income section.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


#### The net profit field should be completed as following:

• Limited company - key total of salary/remuneration and dividends drawn as shown on tax calculation.
• Partnership or LLP - key profit share percentage.
• Sole trader - key net profits.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


#### Documentation needed:

• Latest 2 years' HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) tax calculations and tax year overviews showing years and the directors and shareholders name/initials.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


#### Tax calculations are available in the directors and shareholders online self-assessment account. If they use these, the following details must be visible:

• HMRC logo.
• Unique Tax Reference (UTR).
• Tax year where the most recent is no older than 18 months old.
• Official wording that says: 'This is a copy of information held on your official online SA tax account with HMRC', and 'Submission is 100% complete.'

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


#### Online tax assessments from accountants' commercial software, accompanied by the corresponding tax year overviews are acceptable as long as they show:

• UTR.
• Director/shareholder name.
• Tax year where the most recent is no older than 18 months old.

The tax due figure on the tax calculation and tax year overview will usually match. If there is a difference in the tax figure, we might need updated documents.

The latest two years' full accounts must be finalised and clearly show the net profit for sole traders, the share of net profit for partnerships, or salary and dividends for directors of limited companies.

Profit and loss statements alone aren't acceptable.

The year end for all documents must be the most recent and not be dated more than 18 months before the date of application.

#### Child dependants

These are any children under 18 who the directors or shareholders are the primary carer for. You should also include any children they're expecting or in the process of adopting. Foster children or any children who have an income they can fully support themselves with don't need to be included.

Child maintenance must be keyed as an outgoing commitment, but the child doesn't need to be included as a dependant.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


#### Adult dependant

An adult dependant is someone not included in the mortgage but is financially reliant on the directors or shareholders. This could be a spouse/partner, elderly relative, or any grown-up children in full-time education or unemployed.

If the adult dependant doesn't live at the property all of the time, still key this in the adult dependant section.

If the adult dependant doesn't ever live at the property, they must not be keyed as a dependant, but the related costs must be keyed as a total figure in 'Other commitments'.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


#### We can't accept the following as deposit sources:

• Intercompany loans.
• Vendor gifted deposits.
• Personal loans.
• Second charges.
• The Forces Help to Buy scheme (Long Service Advance of Pay) for military personnel.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


#### More than one director or shareholder

At least one director or shareholder must own a property in the UK in their own name. This will need to be validated before an offer can be made. All other named directors or shareholders can be first time buyers.

In most cases, we'll validate property ownership with a credit search on the directors or shareholders. If we can't do this or the property is unencumbered, we might ask for more evidence.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


#### The property can be let on:

• a single assured shorthold tenancy in England,
• an occupation contract in Wales,
• a private residential tenancy in Scotland.

The minimum tenancy term is six months. The maximum tenancy term is normally 36 months. A maximum tenancy of five years is acceptable under a Dept for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC) model agreement of September 2014 (or as amended) or the Scottish Equivalent.

A BTL remortgage application can't be started without a tenant in place. A tenancy agreement must also be in place. If a tenancy is about to start, there must be a tenancy agreement dated within 14 days of the application confirming the expected rental income.

The property can be let to a company on a corporate let. The maximum term for this is 12 months. Our consent isn't needed to renew the tenancy. But the occupiers need to be named on the tenancy and must be employees of the tenant company.

The maximum number of unrelated tenants is five. They must all be named on the agreement. It's the landlords' responsibility to make sure all legislation is complied with, including (but not restricted to) legislation relating to Tenancy Deposit schemes and HMOs (Houses in Multiple Occupation).

For larger properties, where there is a potential of more than five lettable rooms, the valuer must be satisfied the property and local market reflects single family letting arrangements.

Properties subject to Local Authority Homes in Multiple Occupation (HMO) licensing might be acceptable, subject to the valuer's assessment of suitability based on our

### requirements

.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


#### We can't accept tenants in the following categories:

• Asylum seekers.
• Persons who have or might acquire diplomatic immunity.
• Social landlords, such as housing associations.
• Holiday lets.
• Rent act protected tenants.
• Agents of any of the above.
• Family members of any directors or shareholders.

The tenancy agreement must provide that assignment or sub-lettings to tenants in these categories are not allowed.

• Multiple tenancies, where each tenant signs a separate agreement, aren't acceptable.
• If the property is in Scotland, the landlord must register with the relevant local authority.
• Leaseback and sale properties aren't acceptable.
• Limited company purchases or Trust Deed applications aren't acceptable.
• The property can't have any occupancy restrictions.
• Applications won't be accepted where a second charge is being completed at the same time as the BTL application.

#### Here's an example of how it works

Two directors and shareholders are buying a property together. Director 1 already has two mortgaged BTL properties, and director 2 has one mortgaged BTL property.

In total, they'll have four properties between them, including the one they're buying together, so the application is classified as a portfolio landlord.

Mortgaged BTL properties include those held in a personal name, limited company name, or any other legal entity.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


#### Our process

• Submit all applications online at BM Solutions.
• A question will be asked to find out the number of mortgaged BTLs on the application.
• 3 or less, including the new application, will continue as current process.
• 4-10, including the new application, will need proof of income and supporting documents to be uploaded.
• If mortgaged properties within the portfolio are held in a limited company, we'll need the latest mortgage statement or mortgage offer, if completed in the last 12 months.
• Full information about the portfolio must be keyed.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


#### Information needed includes:

• Addresses.
• Year built and year of purchase.
• Original purchase price.
• Gross monthly rent.
• Estimated property valuation.
• Whether property is leasehold, managed, and mortgaged.

Your application will not progress until all of the above has been fully completed - including completion of the portfolio details screen in the full application.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


#### Portfolio landlords criteria

• No more than 10 BTL mortgaged properties, including the new application.
• Minimum income of  30,000 each application from employment, self-employment, property portfolio profit, or pension/investment income.
• Maximum aggregate portfolio* of 75% LTV.
• Minimum aggregate portfolio rental cover ratio of 145% stressed at 5.5%.
• Property must meet standard criteria.
• Please check the maximum amount the directors and shareholders can borrow here.

* Based on the entire portfolio, including acquiring property and any unencumbered let property.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


#### Unencumbered let properties

These aren't included in the total mortgaged BTL properties. But the rent and property value must be declared in the property schedule and portfolio details sections of the application.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


#### Finance costs

Since 06 April 2020, tax relief on finance costs for landlords of residential properties is restricted to basic rate of income tax, regardless of which tax band the landlord falls into. Accordingly, profit from land and property as it appears on a tax calculation no longer has finance costs deducted.

You'll need to input the latest year's finance costs on the application.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


#### Portfolio landlord help and support

If you need any help with an application, get in touch with our specialist team. You'll get your own dedicated case handler, who will contact you once you submit your application.

#### Properties in England and Wales

Properties in buildings five storeys or higher no longer need an External Wall System (EWS1) form in order to progress an application. We'll also consider applications on properties where cladding remediation work is needed but not yet completed.

EWS1 forms might still be needed for buildings four storeys or lower. The surveyor will advise when an External Wall System (EWS1) form is required to confirm the status of the external wall system and any applicable attachments e.g. balconies on multi occupied, multi storey buildings of any height.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


#### Properties in Scotland

Will still need an EWS1 form regardless of height. Directors or shareholders will have to source the EWS1 form themselves.

The building owner and/or agent is responsible for confirming an external wall system or attachments, such as a balcony, on buildings containing flats has been assessed by a suitable expert.

The EWS1 form must be prepared by a qualified independent professional. They must be a member of one of the professional bodies listed by RICS.

We can't confirm if a property is acceptable until a valuation has been instructed.

For purchase cases, a special condition will be added to the mortgage offer to instruct the conveyancer to advise the directors or shareholders an offer has been made based on the information in an EWS1. It'll also make sure the directors or shareholders know neither us nor the surveyor are liable for information in the EWS1 form.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


#### New build high rise blocks

In England and Wales, The Building (Amendment) Regulations 2018 or local equivalent can be used for new builds over six storeys or 18 metres high. A conveyancer will need to confirm this has been used by the building owner or agent.

This applies to new builds of four storeys or 11 metres high in Scotland.

If this can't be confirmed, please follow the EWS1 process.
