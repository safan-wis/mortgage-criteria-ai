ACCORDION SECTIONS:
----------------------------------------

ADDITIONAL BORROWING
--------------------
  You need to treat requests for additional borrowing by existing mortgage customers as new lending, with the reason fully explained. Current policy rules apply to the combined total of the mortgage and additional lending. There are two exceptions to this (age and term) where policy requirements only apply to the additional amount borrowed.

  A maximum LTV of 85%* may be considered (subject to product availability). A maximum LTV of 80% applies where the purpose of additional borrowing (ie further advance) is for debt consolidation.

  * Maximum LTV for additional borrowing on interest only will depend on the repayment vehicle selected, see interest-only policy section.

  For all new lending requests a valuation must be carried out irrespective of when the original valuation was undertaken.

  Additional borrowing on offset mortgages

  Clients who already have an offset mortgage with us and want to borrow more cant keep their current offset product. Theyll need to choose from one of these options, based on their circumstances.

  UL LIST:
    • Additional borrowing applications can exceed the term of the main mortgage account but must not exceed 40 years from the date the mortgage originally began, or 25 years for a mortgage with any element that is interest only. For Family Springboard mortgages, additional borrowing cant be taken while the deposit is locked, or exceed 35 years
    • Interest only  the total new aggregate amount of interest-only borrowing, including any existing borrowing, must meet current interest-only standards, including for the repayment plan, plausibility assessment and minimum income requirements
    • Repayment plan and LTV  changes in the repayment plan that the lending was already assessed against must meet the current interest-only standards. This applies whether the additional lending is on an interest-only or repayment basis
    • For any applications involving the consolidation of an existing Mortgage Current Account Reserve debt, a condition of offer must be accepted by the customer that their Mortgage Current Account Reserve limit shall be reduced to zero/capped and any rebalancing feature should be switched off
    • Additional borrowing is not allowed to support any demolish and re-build scenarios which are seen as a clear breach in Mortgage Terms & Conditions entered into by the borrower
    • Since 16 October 2019, customers can only hold up to nine accounts in addition to their main mortgage.

  OL LIST:
    • Keep the offset feature and borrow more against the same property. Youll need to submit an application for a new offset mortgage from our offset product range. The application needs to be for the total of the old mortgage balance plus the further borrowing (the total mortgage amount).
    • Keep the offset feature and borrow more when buying a new property. Youll need to submit an application for the new total mortgage amount, selecting a product from our current offset range.
    • Remove the offset feature and borrow more against the same property. Contact us for a bespoke rate switch product code, and you can submit an application to switch their mortgage to an equivalent, non-offset product on the same rate. Once complete, you can submit a new application for the additional borrowing.
    • Remove the offset feature and port the mortgage to a new property. If your client wants to keep their current rate when moving and borrow more, but no longer needs the offset feature, contact us for a bespoke product code. Well port their current rate to an equivalent, non-offset product on the same rate.



ADVERSE CREDIT HISTORY  RESIDENTIAL
-----------------------------------
  County Court Judgements (CCJs/defaults)

  Adverse credit as detailed below must be declined:

  *Includes partially settled defaults which will be referred out to check whether full and final settlement has been made

  Applications can be considered where the above is identified but only where documentary evidence of a settled dispute has been provided by the customer.

  Payment Arrears/Missed Payments

  Application must be declined if any of the following apply:

  Payment Arrangements

  If payment arrangements are identified in the credit search which are still running or have ended less than 1 year prior to the time of application, the case must be declined.

  Over-indebtedness

  Where the total unsecured bureau debt (credit cards, overdrafts and loans) is greater than or equal to the gross annual income used in the affordability assessment then the application will be declined. This includes where customers were looking to consolidate the borrowing on to the mortgage.

  These standards only apply on drawn balances (unused credit limits are not included). This calculation is automatically applied by the system.

  Mortgage or rent arrears

  If arrears of more than 1 month have occurred in the past 6 months, and/or 3 months arrears have occurred in the past 2 years, the case is outside lending policy and is to be declined. However, this decision could be changed if there is an acceptable technical reason, or if evidence of a settled dispute is provided and verified by the lender.

  If this is the case, please contact our Intermediary Mortgage Experts on 0345 073 3330 * to discuss whether we will be able to assist. Lines are open Monday to Friday 9am-5pm.

  Bankruptcy/IVA

  It is not acceptable to lend where any applicant is currently bankrupt or subject to a Debt Relief Order (DRO) and/or Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA) however, lending can be considered provided any bankruptcy, DRO or IVA was registered more than 6 years ago from the date of submission (and hence no longer appears on the credit reference bureau information).

AFFORDABILITY  RESIDENTIAL
--------------------------
  It is important that we demonstrate that an applicant can reasonably afford to repay their mortgage before we agree to enter into a regulated mortgage contract with them. The use of income multiples alone is not sufficient to assess the maximum amount well lend.

  Your clients affordability will also be assessed using information collected in the Affording your Mortgage section of our application. Here, youll need to detail their regular financial commitments to show that they can afford to make the required monthly repayments.

  There are several factors to take into account when assessing your clients ability to repay their mortgage

  Income assessment This should include the applicants actual verified income, net of tax and National Insurance. When making a lending decision or contract variation the underwriters can consider various sources of income (please see the requirements table). The underwriter must consider the variability of the income over time to ensure the mortgage payments remain affordable to the customer. Variable (or non-guaranteed income) must be verified over a sufficient period to inform an assessment of sustainability.

  Expenditure assessment The data captured in the application must take into account committed expenditure (eg credit cards, overdraft, council tax, loans, hire purchase, school fees). Basic essential expenditure and basic quality of living costs will be accounted for in the affordability model.

  Monthly mortgage commitment The monthly repayment must be met from the applicants actual or reasonably anticipated income. If the applicant intends to repay from resources other than income, reference to information given by the applicant must be given on the application form.

  For repayment mortgages The monthly repayment used in affordability must be calculated on a capital and interest repayment basis. This should be based on the applicants current affordability rate or pay rate, whichever is higher. This should also be based on the term of the mortgage or until the applicant is 70, or at the normal retirement of the principal applicant (main income earner), whichever is sooner. For any repayment mortgage term greater than 35 years and up to 40 years, a maximum term of 35 years would be applied for affordability purposes.

  For interest only mortgages The monthly repayment used in affordability must be calculated on a capital and interest repayment basis at the current affordability rate or pay rate, whichever is higher. This should be over an assumed term of 25 years or until the applicant is 70 or at the normal retirement of all applicants, whichever is sooner. Please note, for interest only mortgages the maximum term is 25 years. Where income into retirement from any applicant is required to meet affordability, it is not acceptable to lend on an interest-only basis.

  Second or subsequent properties Second or subsequent properties: commitments in the form of mortgage payments on second properties, other than those on properties confirmed as Buy to Let or Permission to Let properties, will be automatically applied on a standard repayment basis over the outstanding mortgage term at the current affordability rate or current payment amount, whichever is the higher when assessing affordability.

  Where a credit limit applies to the existing mortgage borrowing, then it is this figure, including any undrawn monies, that should be used when assessing affordability.

  In addition, a fixed-value commitment for each additional mortgaged residential property held is applied by the system to cover all other costs  this only applies to other residential properties, i.e. second residential homes, but not any property confirmed as being on a Buy to Let or Permission to Let basis.

  The running costs (e.g. home insurance, utilities and council tax) of any residential unencumbered properties need to be included in the affordability assessment  please manually enter figures on the Commitments screen.

  Buy-to-let/ Permission-to-let properties: Commitments in the form of contractual monthly mortgage payments on background buy to let/ permission to let properties will be applied automatically.

  Remaining disposable income The applicants disposable income  ie, their monthly income after accounting for regular commitments as detailed above, must be sufficient to cover all other general living expenses, eg food, clothing, utility bills, hobbies.

  Disposable income requirements are set by Barclays and must be met in all instances. Where these levels of disposable income are not realised, the application will be declined.



AGE/TERM
--------
  Minimum age: 18

  Maximum age at the end of the mortgage term cannot exceed the oldest applicants 80th birthday.

  Our maximum acceptable retirement age is 75, please note when the retirement age exceeds 70 our underwriting team may review the application and require additional information.

  Where the mortgage term will go beyond age 75 proof of pension income must be provided, where the applicants income is required for affordability.

  Youll need to submit documents to prove affordability for the full mortgage term.

  Our underwriters will need to see documents that show your client will be able to keep up with their mortgage payments when theyve retired.

  Youll also need to confirm that youve discussed affordability in retirement with your client, and that theyre comfortable theyll be able to meet the mortgage repayments until the end of the mortgage term.

  We can consider applications on an interest-only basis up to age 75. However, affordability must be demonstrated up to age 70. For repayment mortgages, terms may extend beyond 75 either where a younger applicant meets the affordability requirements or where customers can show evidence that theyll be able to pay the mortgage in retirement.



ARMED FORCES PERSONNEL
----------------------
  UK Armed Forces Personnel who are currently working in the UK or overseas and wish to buy/re-mortgage a property to let, that is intended to be their main residence in the future or on their eventual return to the UK. It is acceptable to let the mortgage property on an Assured Shorthold Tenancy basis.

  Service Personnel may be offered a Forces Help To Buy Loan (FHTB), which replaces the Long Service Advance of Pay (LSAP). This is usually a 10-year interest-free loan of up to £25,000. This may be used as a deposit to purchase a property but should be treated as a loan commitment in the normal way, with the annual monthly payments being deducted from the applicants income.

  Please see the Help to Buy  Forces Help to Buy policy section for further details.



ALLOWABLE INCOME TABLE
----------------------



BONUS, OVERTIME OR COMMISSION
-----------------------------
  Documentation Monthly Bonus - 3 latest payslips which evidence monthly bonus amounts they have received ( Bonus must appear on 3 out of 3 monthly payslips and at least 1out of 5 weekly payslips or 3 out of 13 weekly payslips) Monthly Overtime or Commission -3 latest payslips which evidence at least 1 amount P60 will be needed where more than 50% of the most recent 3 monthly average is needed to meet affordability. Monthly Bonus Identify if monthly* bonus is on the most recent 3 months* payslips Well never use less than 50% of the most recent 3 months average Average the total monthly bonus amounts from the last 3 months* payslips and use the same payslips to compare the annualised figure against the P60 Youll need to deduct the salary, allowances and any bonus payments that are less frequent than monthly (or more) when reviewing a P60 and calculating the monthly bonus The remaining figure should then be divided by 12 to show the monthly average from the P60 Take the lower of the following 2 figures (unless the minimum 50% applies) 100% of the 3 months average 100% of the latest P60 monthly average *If frequency of pay is not monthly (e.g. bi weekly / 4 weekly / weekly), Please see weekly, 2-weekly or 4-weekly section below. Annual Bonus Youll need to use the gross (pre-tax) bonus figure when calculating your customers bonuses. Bonuses paid less frequently than monthly are classed as annual Bonuses paid monthly or more frequently are classed as monthly* * See Monthly Bonus section for further details Note - Your customer is not required to have been with the same employer for 2 years, however, the most recent annual bonus must have been paid by their current employer and, in all cases, must have been paid within the last 12 months. An annual bonus can be considered where it has only been paid in the most recent year. Payslips The number of payslips required is dependent on the frequency of the bonus. We need evidence of their annual bonus over the last 2 years. If your customer receives their bonus Quarterly then we need 8 payslips which evidence the bonus payment If your customer receives their bonus Half Yearly then we need 4 payslips which evidence the bonus payment If your customer receives their bonus Annually then we need 2 payslips which evidence the bonus payment Note - You can use the payslips to show annual bonuses over the last 2 years (We dont need P60s to validate, and we require no additional calculations). P60s Where your customer cant provide the required payslips, we need to confirm the annual bonus is sustainable using the last 2 years P60s. P60s are only acceptable where the customer is not also in receipt of regular bonus, overtime or commission. Obtain the P60s to confirm bonus over the last 2 years. Calculate the annual bonus figure for both years If the latest years bonus figure is lower than the previous years, you can only use the latest years figure. If it is higher than the previous years you can use an average of the two years Calculate Overtime or commission Identify if monthly* overtime/commission is showing on at least 1 of the most recent 3 months* payslips Average the total monthly* overtime/commission amounts from the last 3 months* payslips and use the same payslips to compare the annualised figure against the P60 Youll need to deduct the salary, allowances and any bonus payments that are less frequent than monthly (or more) when reviewing a P60 and calculating the monthly overtime/commission The remaining figure should then be divided by 12 to show the monthly average from the P60 Take the lower of the following 2 figures (unless the minimum 50% applies) 100% of the 3 months average 100% of the latest P60 monthly average **If frequency of pay is not monthly (e.g. bi weekly / 4 weekly / weekly), see weekly, 2-weekly or 4-weekly section below Examples Example 1 (evidenced on 3 consecutive most recent payslips) Basic = £20,000 - Monthly bonus (average over last 3 months) = £1,000 - P60 Total income = £23,000 Bonus amount (P60 value) = £3,000 (divided by 12 = £250 per month) Monthly bonus Figure to use = £500 per month Decision - As the P60 monthly average value after basic salary is deducted is less than 50% of the latest 3 payslips, the figure added to application is £500 per month (50% current average monthly bonus = £1,000 x 50%) Example 2 (evidenced on at least 1 out of 3 recent payslips) Basic annual income = £20,000 - Monthly overtime (average over last 3 months) = £1,000 per month - P60 Total annual income = £29,000 Less Basic annual income = £20,000 Overtime amount (P60 average value) = £9,000 (divided by 12 = £750 per month) Overtime Figure to use = £750 per month Decision - As the P60 monthly average value after basic salary is deducted is lower than 100% of the average of the latest 3 payslips, the figure added to MAX is £750 per month (use the lower of the 2 averages) Example 3 (evidenced on at least 1 out of 3 recent payslips) Basic annual income = £20,000 - Commission (average over last 3 months) = £1,000 per month - P60 Total annual income = £38,000 Less Basic annual income = £20,000 Commission amount (P60 average value) = £18,000 (divided by 12 = £1,500 per month) Commission Figure to use = £1,000 Decision - As the P60 monthly average value after basic salary is deducted is higher than 100% of average of the latest 3 payslips, the figure added to MAX is £1,000 per month (use the lower of the 2 averages) If income Then* Monthly Use latest months payslip figure 4-weekly Use latest months payslip figure Multiply this figure by 13 (for annual figure) Divide annual figure by 12 2-weekly Total figures from last 3 payslips Divide this by 6 (for averaged weekly pay) Multiply this by 52 (for annual figure) Divide this by 12 (for equivalent monthly figure) Weekly Total the figures from last 5 payslips Divide this figure by 5 (for averaged weekly figure) Multiply the average weekly figure by 52 (for annual figure) Divide annual figure by 12 Non-cash compensation Customers may choose to have their bonus payment paid into alternate places instead of having it paid cash. E.g. their pension or share scheme etc. This can still be used toward affordability when assessing a mortgage application. Where shares are a feature of an applicants total income awarded by their employer (e.g. in the form of restricted stock units (RSUs) that are subject to a vesting schedule) this cannot be considered standard income in the affordability assessment for retail mortgage applications



CLADDING/THE BUILDING SAFETY ACT 2022
-------------------------------------
  UL LIST:
    • The Building Safety Act 2022 provides protection from the remediation costs of replacing external combustible material where there is an agreed approach to remediation in place.
    • Buildings that have external wall systems may require an EWS1 rating. Where a rating is A3 OR B2 this indicates some form of remediation is required.
    • There are a variety of options available to leaseholders and Barclays made a commitment to help customers living in or buying impacted properties where there is a qualifying lease or planned remediation in place by a recognised body.
    • To support applications for impacted properties that require remediation we will need one of the following to be provided to us with your clients mortgage application. Written confirmation of intention to complete the works from a developer who has signed a contact with the government. You can see a full list of developers who have signed the pledge on .GOV.UK A Building Safety Act 2022 Government Leaseholder Deed of Certificate Form accompanied by a Building Safety Act 2022 Landlords Certificate Written confirmation from a housing association confirming they are completing the remediation or written confirmation from DLUHC confirming the property is approved for funding to remediate. For letters from DLUHC, these should clearly state if any financial liability is passed to the leaseholder or be accompanied by a leaseholder or landlord certificate.
    • Written confirmation of intention to complete the works from a developer who has signed a contact with the government. You can see a full list of developers who have signed the pledge on .GOV.UK
    • A Building Safety Act 2022 Government Leaseholder Deed of Certificate Form accompanied by a Building Safety Act 2022 Landlords Certificate
    • Written confirmation from a housing association confirming they are completing the remediation or written confirmation from DLUHC confirming the property is approved for funding to remediate. For letters from DLUHC, these should clearly state if any financial liability is passed to the leaseholder or be accompanied by a leaseholder or landlord certificate.
    • Where your client provides the Landlord and Leaseholder certificates it is important to capture the financial commitment they will have. You can find the total sum payable on the landlord certificate within the work undertaken on relevant defects section.
    • Any amount the client must pay will be taken over a 10-year period. Therefore, the amount due on Monday 14th February 2022, should be divided by 120 months and captured as or within the service charge to ensure affordability is met.
    • Developer or Housing Association remediated properties will have no financial liability passed to the leaseholder and therefore will not impact affordability.
    • Please note: if the application is for a property that requires fire safety remediation we will only proceed where we have satisfactory evidence in the format/s detailed above. In the event this cannot be provided we would be unable to support your customers mortgage application at this time.
    • For customers who already hold their mortgage with Barclays against a property that requires remediation we can support rate switch applications, permission to let requests and conversion from BTL to residential or vice versa without evidence being required. Where any additional borrowing is required for existing customers, the rules detailed would apply.



COMMITMENTS  RESIDENTIAL
------------------------
  The monthly amount to be paid towards the following commitments (including those originated and/or operated outside of the UK) must be deducted from the applicant/s net income to prove affordability:

  Other considerations

  Notes: If any undeclared commitment is identified this will generate a remodelling of the application and potentially a change in lending decision.

  UL LIST:
    • Hire Purchase Agreements including Mail Order Payments, Bank Loans, Finance Loans, Payday Loan Advances (full amount outstanding applies) or Second Charges
    • Future Commitments - commitments that become due during the term of the mortgage must be included in the affordability assessment.

    • In addition to being included in the Special Scheme information in Borrowing Requirements, all Shared Equity loan balances, including England & Wales Help to Buy Equity loans, must be recorded within Financial Commitments under Shared Equity if interest is due within the mortgage term. The system will then take 3% per annum of the outstanding balance of the loan as a commitment for affordability. Please note: only in circumstances where no interest is due on the shared equity loan at any stage within the mortgage term (such as the Scotland HTB equity scheme) or the equity loan is being paid off in full as part of the application, should the equity loan not be recorded as a Financial Commitment If repaying part of an interest charging equity loan, these should be input as two Shared Equity commitments  one for the Shared Equity loan balance to be repaid (marked to be repaid) and one for the Shared Equity loan balance to remain (marked not to be repaid)
    • Second or subsequent properties: commitments in the form of mortgage payments on second properties, other than those on properties confirmed as Buy to Let or Permission to Let properties, will automatically be applied on a standard repayment basis over the outstanding mortgage term at the current affordability rate or current payment amount, whichever is the higher when assessing affordability. Where a credit limit applies to the existing mortgage borrowing, then it is this figure, including any undrawn monies, that should be used when assessing affordability. In addition, a fixed-value commitment for each additional mortgaged residential property held is applied by the system to cover all other costs  this only applies to other residential properties, i.e. second residential homes, but not any property confirmed as being on a Buy to Let or Permission to Let basis.
    • Buy to let/ Permission to let properties: Commitments in the form of contractual monthly mortgage payments on background buy to let/ permission to let properties will be applied automatically
    • The running costs of any unencumbered second property need to be included in the affordability assessment  please manually enter figures on the Commitments screen. This should include Gas and electricity Water House insurance Council tax Ground rent/service charge
    • Gas and electricity
    • Water
    • House insurance
    • Council tax
    • Ground rent/service charge

    • Regular Pension Payments  including any additional voluntary payments (such as AVCs) being paid regularly from income. One-off contributions  for example from an annual bonus  can be disregarded (pension contributions will be calculated automatically as part of the affordability assessment.

    • The cost of any bridging loan
    • Court orders relating to maintenance payments or judgement debts
    • Child Support Agency (CSA) payments

    • Foreign Credit Commitments - Where a mortgage applicant has any credit commitment denominated in a currency other than GBP, this will be converted to sterling using Barclays Foreign Note Rate including balance and regular payments. This will be completed on the day the initial decision is obtained (i.e DIP 1)

  UL LIST:
    • Any loan/fixed repayment debt with less than 6 months to run can be ignored, provided that the total balance of loans in this category does not exceed £1,000
    • The total amount outstanding against any payday loan advance must be deducted from the applicants net income when assessing affordability
    • Any commitment which is to be repaid from the new proposed mortgage advance can be ignored provided a specific offer condition is made to this effect
    • Any unpaid tax evidenced from the HMRC tax overview document must be treated as a commitment in the period it falls due
    • Where an applicant is in receipt of benefit income, please ensure any associated regular costs incurred by the customer  for which this benefit income is intended  is included as a commitment. For example, if the applicant is claiming Personal Independence Payments (PIP), it may be appropriate to record any regular care costs.



CONTRACT WORKERS
----------------
  Our policy on applicants who are contractors depends on if they are working on an employed or self-employed basis.

  Applicants employed in professional roles where contracts are provided on a fixed term basis, but each contract rolls to the next placement and so the overarching employment does not change (i.e. Junior Doctors, Teachers, Junior Solicitors), should be keyed as employed. These roles will all receive a salary.

  All contractors

  Umbrella, Agency or Fixed Term contractors

  The following policy applies to contract workers who are employed on a PAYE basis (e.g. via an umbrella company or agency): Income is calculated on an employed basis using 3 months (or equivalent) pay slips, and taking an average where necessary, any holiday pay received is included within the average. Where the customer has any form of variable pay or bonus this should be calculated using employed policy.

  Applications for contractors in occupations such as professional sport will be assessed on a case-by-case basis to check for sustainability and plausibility. By recording these types of customer on the application as Employed - Fixed Term Contract this will ensure these checks can take place.

  Self-employed contractors

  For contract workers operating on a self-employed basis affordability calculations will depend on how their business is structured. Where ALL of the following additional requirements are met a daily rate calculation may be applied

  Daily-rate calculation

  To calculate gross income, you will

  If the contract expresses pay as an hourly-rate, then the applicants income should be calculated on the assumption there are a maximum of 40 working hours per week, unless the contract or the applicant specifies a lower number of hours. The resulting weekly amount should then be multiplied by 46 working weeks to arrive at the gross annual income for affordability purposes.

  Additional commitments (where daily-rate is used) - When the daily-rate calculation is being used; credit commitments for which the limited company is liable/responsible (e.g. business loans, including bounce back loans) should be recorded within the application and considered as part of the overall affordability assessment. On the application, the monthly payment should be entered as shown on the business bank statements, the outstanding balance detailed as £1 and the remaining term as 1y 0m.

  The following additional documents are required if the daily-rate calculation is being applied

  All contractors using the daily rate should be recorded on the application as Employed - Fixed Term Contract.

  Contractors not employed via an umbrella or agency or that do not meet the daily rate criteria must document income following our self-employed policy. Please refer to our self-employed and allowable income sections for further details.

  UL LIST:
    • There can be no more than a 6-week gap between contracts
    • Evidence of 12 months contracts (a minimum of 2 contracts must be provided if latest contract covers <12 months) is required  the only exception is where the applicant has recently moved from employee to contractor and provides services to their previous employer: In this case, we require confirmation that the client employed the applicant for at least 3 years before they became a contractor along with a copy of the service contract showing terms of remuneration, duration of contract and conditions of cancellation or termination
    • There must be 3 months remaining on their current contract or alternatively be able to provide evidence of the next one

  UL LIST:
    • The firm is a limited company
    • The firm does not employ anyone (other than the applicant(s) themselves)
    • The applicant(s) collectively own 100% shares
    • The applicants current contract equates to at least £218 per day or £50,000 per year (gross)
    • Mortgage Loan-to-Value is  90%

  UL LIST:
    • Identify the lower of the following  Average Daily Rate of Pay (excl. VAT) from the 2 most recent contracts OR the most recent Daily Rate of Pay (excl. VAT) OR the actual income shown on the bank statements;
    • then multiple by 5 and;
    • then multiple by 46 to give the annual figure

  UL LIST:
    • Latest 3 full months consecutive personal bank statements confirming receipt of income
    • Latest 3 full months consecutive business bank statements confirming receipt of income



CREDIT REFERENCE SEARCHES
-------------------------
  A full personal credit check will be undertaken on each applicant.



CRITERIA AND PACKAGING GUIDE
----------------------------
  Criteria and Packaging Guide [PDF, 757KB].



CRYPTOASSETS
------------
  You should make us aware if any portion of the customers income or source of wealth is cryptoasset-based or consists of investments in a crypto-related software business (e.g. Blockchain/DLT Tech firms).

  Cryptoassets can include cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin), utility tokens (unregulated cryptoassets usually issued as part of an ICO/ITO), asset tokens including stable coins (asset-backed coins with a value pegged to a physical asset of some kind) and security tokens.

  Applications of this nature will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.



DEPENDENT RELATIVE
------------------
  Applications for the purchase of residential properties that will be occupied by a dependant relative of the applicant are acceptable under lending standards.

  If the property being bought is being sold by a dependant relative who will then remain in the property after the sale takes place, the application must be declined.

  Any dependent relative must be disclosed on the application as a financial dependent.

  Any dependant relative must be occupying the property rent-free.

  Any persons aged 17 or over who are not party to the mortgage but are, or will be, occupying the property during the mortgage term must be declared on the application as an occupier.



DEPOSIT
-------
  Where a property is being purchased, applicants are expected to provide a deposit of at least 5% of the purchase price

  The personal stake may vary depending on specialist schemes or circumstances where loan to value restrictions apply.

  The applicants must declare the source and amount of their deposit on the application form. Usually, the deposit will be from the applicants own savings, the sale of their previous property, a gift from relatives/partner or a combination of these sources.

  Barclays consider a relative or partner as the borrowers spouse or civil partner; a person (whether or not of the opposite sex) whose relationship with the borrower has the characteristics of the relationship between husband and wife; or the borrowers parent, brother, sister, child (including stepchild), grandparent or grandchild.

  It is not acceptable for applicants to resort to secondary borrowing to fund the deposit, for example, by raising a personal loan. The only exception to this rule is, where the applicant is raising a deposit from the equity in another property.

  For all purchase applications the applicant must provide documented proof of the source of the deposit.



DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY
-------------------
  Staff working in the UK for embassies, high commissions and international organisations (eg, United Nations) benefit from diplomatic immunity. Mortgage requests from applicants who have diplomatic immunity are outside of lending standards and should be declined.



DISCOUNTED MARKET SALES
-----------------------
  As part of their affordable housing obligations, local authorities, housing associations and private developers or house builders may offer properties for sale at a discount, set at a percentage of open market value  for example, 80%. This discount may apply in perpetuity which means that, for subsequent sales, the owner must sell the property at the same discount based on the open market value at that time.

  The discount arrangement is usually under a section 106 restriction. Discounted market sales are acceptable provided this restriction does not apply to the lender who may sell the property at open market value, this is known as a mortgagee in possession clause. The maximum nomination period we accept is 3 months.

  Maximum 85% LTV based on the discounted sale price. Where there is a section 106 agreement, the LTV must not exceed 80% of the open market value (not the discounted sale price).

  Product availability is based on the full market value.



EMPLOYED APPLICANTS
-------------------
  Youll need to have been in continuous employment for the last three months with no gaps. This doesnt have to be with the same employer, but if youve been with your current employer less than three months, your case will be assessed by the team. They might ask you to provide additional information.

  For details of documentary requirements for employed income, please see Criteria and Packaging Guide [PDF, 756KB].

  Second Job

  100% of income will be accepted if, sustainability is evidenced.

  Employed by relative

  Where an applicant works for a relative or partner* who owns more than 20% of the company in which the applicant is employed by, we will treat them as employed, however we must take additional steps to confirm sustainability of income. The last 3 months payslips, corresponding bank statements and latest P60 must be provided. Where there is subsequently any concern with regards to sustainability of income required, underwriters should request trading accounts for the company for the last 2 years, or where employed by an LLP, a letter from the Finance Director/Senior Partner confirming income.

  *Relative or Partner is defined as The borrowers spouse or civil partner; a person (whether or not of the opposite sex) whose relationship with the borrower has the characteristics of the relationship between husband and wife; or the borrowers parent, brother, sister, child (including step child), grandparent or grandchild.



FAMILY SPRINGBOARD
------------------
  The Family Springboard Mortgage is a product designed to allow family members and others to help a loved one get on, or up, the property ladder. Through it helpers provide a 10% security deposit held in a Helpful Start account and applicants are then able to purchase a property with no deposit or a personal deposit starting at just 5%. After 5 years the 10% contribution is released back to the helpers, with interest added (restrictions may apply), and the applicant continues with their mortgage.

  An applicant cannot apply for a Family Springboard mortgage if they own a BTL property or have a second residential property, even if it is on a Permission to Let basis.

  UL LIST:
    • Applications to be submitted with a deposit from 0% to 9.99% (including any application fees)

    • A legal charge must be obtained over the Helpful Start account deposit monies before any mortgage monies are released and the deposit account must be frozen for the period required to support the mortgage. While the charge is in place the Helpful Start account is not covered by the Financial Services Compensation scheme
    • The Helpful Start account holders must obtain Independent Legal Advice, to be evidenced by Mortgage Services prior to the release of any mortgage monies. The borrower and the Helper may have the same solicitor for the Independent Legal Advice (though this is dependent on the discretion of the solicitors firm)

  Mortgage applicants must be first-time buyers who havent previously held a mortgage in the UK or abroad. This applies to all applicants for a joint application.



FORCES HELP TO BUY
------------------
  Service personnel may be offered a Forces Help To Buy Loan (FHTB), which replaces the Long Service Advance of Pay (LSAP). This is usually a 10-year interest-free loan of up to £25,000. This may be used as a deposit to purchase a property but should be treated as a loan commitment in the normal way with the monthly payments being deducted from the applicants income.

  The sourcing of the deposit in this way must be declared in the mortgage submission, and advisors or underwriters may ask the applicant to provide the Personal Information Note, which will contain details of their loan.

  Note: Forces Help to Buy may be used as a deposit to help fund the purchase of a property under the Help to Buy: equity loan, but it cannot be used to help fund a deposit for buying a property through the Help to Buy: mortgage guarantee scheme.



GREEN HOME MORTGAGES  RESIDENTIAL
---------------------------------
  The home must be a new-build and have an energy efficiency rating of 81 or higher, or be a new-build with energy efficiency band A or B. Theres no other specific eligibility criteria, and the application process is the same as with any other purchase, but applicants will need one of the following to prove the propertys energy efficiency rating

  House builders can verbally confirm the propertys energy efficiency rating straight away, and applicants can use this to progress their application. Theyll still need to send us an eligible EPC or PEA, and should aim to do this as soon as possible. We wont be able to complete their mortgage without one of these documents.

  To find out more, take a look at our lending criteria and our dedicated new build hub

INTEREST-ONLY MORTGAGES - RESIDENTIAL
-------------------------------------
  The maximum loan to value allowed on an interest-only basis is 50% where the repayment strategy is the sale of the mortgaged property, or 75% where the repayment strategy is another allowable source.

  Where the repayment strategy is the sale of the mortgaged property, customers are required to have a minimum equity of:

  £300,000 for properties in Greater London £250,000 for properties in South-East & East Anglia £200,000 for properties in all other regions

  The table further below lists the postcodes for each region and equity requirement.

  The maximum term for an interest-only mortgage is 25 years and it must not extend into retirement. Additionally, affordability must be demonstrated no later than age 70.

  The maximum income multiple applicable to interest only mortgages is 5.00x (please see the Income multiples section of our lending criteria for full policy details).

  There is a minimum income criteria required to be eligible for interest-only borrowing (including part and part borrowing):

  Income must meet lending standards requirements with regards allowable gross income types i.e. Basic + sustainable allowances + self-employed income.

  Given the importance of the minimum income criteria, and to protect your customers, please ensure that the minimum requirements are met  particularly where a customer is at the margins of income threshold.

  Debt consolidation is not allowed for existing or new interest-only borrowing. The only exceptions to this being where an existing customer has a drawn mortgage reserve balance and wants to consolidate this, or where a customer wishes to add an ERC to the balance of the mortgage when remortgaging to us from a competitor.

  The Barclays Group requires all customers who take an interest-only mortgage to have in place a repayment plan for their loan on completion of the advance. Unless using sale of property to be mortgaged, we require the repayment vehicle to have been in place for 12 months. The Barclays Group will consider one, or a combination of the following as acceptable repayment plans for interest only mortgages:

  Where your client wishes to use any other method of repayment to repay the interest-only amount other than the acceptable repayment plans detailed above, this is not acceptable. While it will be the customers responsibility to maintain the repayment strategy throughout the term of the mortgage, as a responsible lender, it is important for us to ensure all interest-only mortgages are supported by an acceptable repayment strategy which will be sufficient to cover the interest-only mortgage on maturity.

  Part and Part Borrowing  customers can borrow up to 85% LTV by choosing a Part & Part repayment option. The interest only element of the loan must be up to a maximum of 75% LTV (or 50% where the repayment strategy is the sale of the mortgaged property).

  In addition, where the repayment strategy is the sale of the mortgaged property, at the outset there must be a minimum equity (this includes any capital and interest borrowing) after accounting for any interest only lending amount of:

  The table below lists the postcodes for each region and equity requirement.

  For example, for a £600,000 property in Greater London (based on the valuation or purchase price  whichever is lower), to meet the equity requirement the customer could borrow maximum of £300,000 on an interest only basis (50%), and £210,000 on capital and interest repayment (35%). So, the total LTV is 85%.

  Transactions at Undervalue  eligibility must be based on the actual purchase price and not the property valuation

  Existing interest only customers

  Existing interest only customers wishing to borrow additional funds or port must meet the current lending standards relating to interest only. This includes meeting the minimum income threshold. Existing customers who do not meet current lending standards for interest only would need to switch their repayment type to capital and interest

  Interest-only repayment vehicles

  We require a plausibility check to be done on all interest-only mortgages as per the assessment guidelines in the table below. This will determine if your client can borrow the required amount on an interest-only basis. Documentary evidence must be submitted with the mortgage application and will be checked as part of the underwriting process.

  UL LIST:
    • Sole application  the applicant must have a gross income of at least £75,000
    • Joint application  one applicant must have a gross income of at least £75,000

  UL LIST:
    • The minimum lease term we accept is 70 years at the point of application. Where the lease is under 70 years at the point of application these will only be considered where the lease is being extended within the mortgages transaction and any offer would include a condition to ensure the lease is extended by the legal representatives for the application.



LOAN PURPOSE
------------
  Lending can be for any purpose except for the purchase of a timeshare, business-related lending, funding of any stock market trading, gambling or to make monthly mortgage payments.

  No discretion applies to this area.



LOAN TO VALUE (LTV) - RESIDENTIAL

  The following maximum LTV criteria apply; lowest LTV takes precedent:

  Special Schemes

  See the Mortgage Schemes section for full details of specific residential mortgage schemes supported by Barclays.

  *** Product availability is based on the full market value.

  Notes:

  UL LIST:
    • Product availability for transactions at undervalue or where there is a builder/vendor deposit is based on the full market value.
    • When calculating LTV the aggregate loan amount used should not include the capitalised Barclays product fee applicable to that application.
    • The Affordability Assessment and lending for income multiples is to be based on the total advance including the addition of any fees.
    • Where the loan size is >£5m, underwriters retain the discretion to reduce the maximum LTV, based upon individual circumstances.

MIXED-USE PROPERTIES - RESIDENTIAL
----------------------------------
  A property is classified as mixed use if there is any element of commercial use  ie, it is used in part for non-residential purposes, such as a shop, doctors surgery or office. This includes situations where the property itself is wholly residential but there is a commercial use of adjoining/surrounding buildings or land included in the mortgage security  such as stables or sub-let cottages.

  The decision to lend will be based on:

  All mixed-use properties fall outside of standard policy and will be assessed by an underwriter on their individual merits.

  In all cases, the local authority planning classification must be solely residential.

  Please note that properties classed as Live/Work Units are not acceptable for either Buy to Let or Residential lending.

  At least 40% of the property must be used as the applicants main residence and the remainder must be used exclusively by the applicant for their own business purposes.

  Mixed-use properties are limited to 80% LTV and certain commercial uses will not be considered:

  Mixed-use properties are not acceptable for Shared Ownership/Equity nor Buy To Let.

    • Products under the NewBuy scheme allowing the maximum LTV to be increased to 95% on new build purchases in England for specific participating builders are available under this borrowing structure for the purchase of principal residence of named occupier/s



NEW BUILD PROPERTIES - RESIDENTIAL
----------------------------------
  For Residential and BTL lending purposes the definition of a new build is a property that was first registered 2 or fewer years ago and the property is subject to first sale by the developer, regardless of time or any rental usage in the interim. This may be because the property is a new construction, a conversion or a renovation from an earlier use.

  Builders deposit and incentives

  Builder financial incentives are acceptable provided the incentive does not have to be repaid and the builder/developer does not intend to register a charge against the property.

  It is acceptable for financial incentives to be used towards funding the deposit, provided the borrower is funding at least 5% of the purchase price from their own funds (this may include a gift from a relative).

  Where the combined value of any financial incentives exceeds 5% of the valuation (or purchase price where lower), the amount of the incentive greater than 5% will be deducted from the valuation (or purchase price where lower) and the LTV, for the purposes of calculating the maximum loan amount, will be calculated based on the resultant value:

  Example (new build house):

  *Refer to current criteria for the prevailing maximum LTV

  Upgrades forming an integral part of the property would not be considered as a part of the 5% cash incentive threshold. Examples of these would be:

  In all instances where there is an incentive being offered, the applicant(s) must provide full details of the type and amount as part of the application submission and all such incentives must be declared to the valuer on the UK Finance Disclosure form in order that they can be taken into account when valuing the property.

  Offer validity

  A mortgage offer is valid for six months from the date we receive the application.

  New-build property sales are often agreed off plan, or in the early stages of development. As a result, completion might take longer than six months. If an offer doesnt complete within six months, we can usually extend it for another six months without the need for you to submit the status documents again.

  Well only be able to extend the offer period with confirmation that the customers circumstances havent changed significantly since the original application was submitted  youll need to confirm this using the New Build Mortgage Offer Extension form. Well also need to assess the application again against current lending standards, and carry out a new credit search.

  If theres been a significant change to the customers circumstances, well need to carry out a full underwriting assessment, including a status assessment. We might need to offer the customer a different mortgage product. The customer will need to cover all costs involved.

  Second properties

  If a customer already owns a property (and theyre not selling that property), our maximum LTV is 80%. Under specialist schemes like Help to Buy, a customer wont be able to buy a new property if they own any other properties (including residential, buy to let or held-on-permission to let).

  Sub-sales and sale contract reassignments

  Sub-sales or sale contract/lease reassignments happen if a new-build property is currently contracted for sale to a third party and hasnt yet completed.

  These are acceptable as long as

  Well decline any transaction that doesnt meet all of these criteria.

  More information about new builds

  We are happy to consider a mortgage for an applicant who has existing properties (whether mortgaged or unencumbered).

  Where the applicants have an existing/second residential property that has not been sold and there is reason to believe is not to be sold before completion (includes where held/to be held on a PTL basis), an application is acceptable subject to a maximum LTV of 80% applying to the property being purchased providing:

  * Relative or Partner is defined as The borrowers spouse or civil partner; a person (whether or not of the opposite sex) whose relationship with the borrower has the characteristics of the relationship between husband and wife; or the borrowers parent, brother, sister, child (including stepchild), grandparent or grandchild.

  Additional borrowing and remortgages can be considered where any additional funds are for essential home improvements.

  Where any existing property is held on a Buy to Let basis, it is acceptable to consider lending up to a maximum LTV of 90%.

  If the mortgages held are on a Buy to Let (BTL) or Permission to Let (PTL) basis, then the contractual monthly payment will be treated as commitment when assessing affordability (rental income should be evidenced as self-employed income).

  For background Buy to Let Mortgages, you will need to provide one of the following

  For background PTL Mortgages you will need to provide

  Where the original loan can NOT be confirmed on a Buy to Let or Permission to Let basis

NUMBER OF APPLICANTS
--------------------
  The maximum number of borrowers allowable is 4. Where there are 3 or more applicants, the Barclays Group will use only the 2 highest incomes when applying income multiples and assessing affordability. All financial commitments from all applicants will be taken into account when assessing affordability.

  Only 2 borrowers are allowed for Openplan Offset Mortgages.



OFFER VALIDITY
--------------
  A mortgage offer is valid for a 6-month period from the date the mortgage application is received by our teams.

  Any offer that does not complete within this period must be re-submitted as a new application with the exception of New Build Purchase applications which can be assessed against current lending standards with a refreshed credit search and re-offered for a further period of 6 months with the existing product or a product from the current range.

  This is subject to receiving confirmation that there has been no material change to the customer(s) circumstances since the original application was submitted using the New Build Mortgage Offer Extension Declaration form. If there has been a material change, the application will be fully re-assessed against current lending standards.

  An updated valuation should be requested in all scenarios with the exception of where the tolerance, referred to below, applies and for New Build Purchase applications where the original valuation will be accepted. Any subsequent extension requirement will be subject to full re-submission.

  The valuation validity period aligns with the offer validity period of 6 months from submission with the exception of New Build Purchase applications which are re-offered for a further period of 6 months with the valuation validity aligned to the new offer validity period.

  Where notice has been given that the proposed property has fallen through and a new property found, a new application must be submitted unless purchase price and mortgage amount are all unchanged and completion is anticipated within 6 months of the original submission. A product will need to be selected from the current range available unless the original product remains available.

  For non new build purchase and remortgage we also offer 2 week extension

  Applications can only be extended once and a new offer will be produced for the solicitor so they can proceed with the completion.



OVERAGE
-------
  Overage is an agreement in which the seller can obtain a portion of the future value of a property. This increase in value can be attributed to a future development. Where a property is sold to a buyer, and its worth more when the property is sold on, the seller may be entitled to claim back some of the difference in sales prices. For this to happen, the value needs to have increased for one of the reasons set out in the overage deed  for example, the land has planning permission.

  -Negative- overage can apply where the buyer covenants with the vendor on the sale of the property that, eg, no development will take place on the property that the vendor does not permit or without the vendors consent.

  To ensure the vendor gets the benefit of the overage payment the deed is usually secured by any or all of the following methods: a charge or restriction secured against the property, a direct deed of covenant or a guarantee.

  They are usually very complicated arrangements and are have sometimes been found to contain defective drafting.

  It is not acceptable to lend to new customers where there is an existing Overage agreement or where it is intended to create one on completion of the purchase/re-mortgage.



OVERPAYMENTS AND RATE SWITCH JOURNEY
------------------------------------
  Where a customer has made overpayments, it is important you look at both section 3 and 6 of the ESIS document.

  Section 3 will include the balance after any overpayments have been accounted for.

  In section 6 you will see the current outstanding balance without overpayments being considered. For this reason, the balance will be higher in section 6 if overpayments have been made.

  The monthly payment figure is based on the full outstanding balance (this is before any overpayment is considered). When the rate switch has completed the customer will be sent a letter which will advise of the monthly payment considering any overpayment balance.

  Customers can choose to apply their overpayments to the mortgage balance outstanding, but it is important to check if any early repayment charges would apply.

  See images below for further clarity:

  Section 3 of the ESIS

  Note: This is the section showing the balance with over payments taking into account.

  Section 6 of the ESIS

  Note: Here the mortgage balance is higher as the customer has an overpayment balance of £6846 which is not being taken into account and why the balance is different between this section and section 3. The monthly payment value is based on this higher balance but there is no need to query this with us and you can advise your customer they will receive a letter that details the monthly payment after their rate is changed which will be a lower figure as it will take into account the overpayments held.

  Note: Per Annum is the twelvemonth period from the end date of the product. For example, a rate which is fixed until 30 April 2014 - the scheme end date is 30/04/2014 therefore the annual period runs backwards from 30/04/2014 to 01/05/2013, 30/04/2013 to 01/05/2012 etc.



PERMISSION TO LET
-----------------
  Your clients can apply for permission to let if theyre looking to move away from a property temporarily and let it out, for example, if theyre relocating for work or are a member of the armed forces. Before they apply, theyll need to meet these conditions

  Like for like porting - Where an existing mortgage customer wishes to port their mortgage to a new property on a like for like (or reduced) basis and the lending proposition is outside of current lending standards, including affordability and score, such requests can be considered provided:

  There is no increase to the current borrowing amount outstanding There is no increase in the term of the current mortgage All parties to the current mortgage remain unchanged There is no arrears history within the last 12 months on the current mortgage (with the exception of technical arrears)

  Note: Customers may not port their mortgage product where Permission to Let has been granted.

  Help to Buy and Family Springboard

  Our Help to Buy and Family Springboard products are not portable. However, customers will have their Early Repayment Charge (ERC) refunded if they repay the existing mortgage in full and request an equivalent Barclays residential mortgage product to purchase their new property. Please contact 0345 073 3330 for support obtaining this.

  Each request is subject to application and must meet our standard lending policy, as well as the following

Customers requiring additional borrowing can either select an Offset product from the current range for the total loan amount required, or they may port their loan balance to a Ported Tracker at their existing interest rate and then take any additional borrowing on a product from the current range.
    • Mortgage Current Account Reserves  Some customers may have a Mortgage Current Account Reserve. These are not portable and if there are any drawn funds at the time of redemption they must be repaid. A new Reserve will not be offered on the customers new mortgage.

SELF-EMPLOYED
-------------
  Applicants are classed as self-employed when they hold over a 20% share in a company.

  For details of documentary requirements for self-employed, please see Criteria and Packaging Guide [PDF, 757KB].

  PAT (Profit after tax)

  Profit, after any applicable corporation tax has been deducted, can be considered towards the affordability assessment, in addition to the applicants directors salary where applicable, where the following requirements are met:

  The maximum amount of Limited Company PAT that can be considered as part of the overall affordability assessment is the lower of:

  The amount of PAT used will be determined by the percentage shareholding of the applicant. E.g. where the borrower is a 70% shareholder a maximum 35% of PAT can be considered (50% of 70%)

  The Maximum amount of PAT used towards affordability cannot exceed 5x the average {Salary + Dividends} paid to the applicant(s) over 2 most recent years, as evidenced by the 2 latest tax calculations.

  Where more than 25% of the companys trading income is received in a currency other than GBP the maximum amount of PAT that can be used towards affordability reduces to 40% (further reduced where the applicants combined shareholding is less than 100%, as described above).

  Applicants that have received a loan from the company that remains outstanding at the point of application would require the amount they are repaying each month to be captured as a commitment within the affordability assessment as 1/12 of the outstanding amount (as evidenced by an accountants letter) Detail needed for accountants letter can be found in Useful documents under Limited Company Profit After Tax

  For more information please refer to the Limited Company Profit After Tax form.

    • Borrowing must be by way of a Barclays Residential Mortgage product
    • The lease should be in the standard form produced by the Homes and Communities Agency incorporating a Mortgage Protection Clause



SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION - RESIDENTIAL
--------------------------------------
  Depending on the circumstances of your clients application, supporting documents may be required for the mortgage to be assessed and underwritten. By providing the documentation we need at the outset youll help us make the experience for you and your client as smooth and efficient as possible.

  Submitting applications via MAX will enable us to provide the best possible service.

  For details of documentary requirements for employed income, please see Criteria and Packaging Guide [PDF, 757KB].



SHORT-TERM LETTING
------------------
  People who have residential mortgages with us can let out their property, or part of their property (for example, a room or an annexe), using short-term letting platforms weve approved. They dont have to get permission from us, as long as

  Online short-term occupancy platforms we accept

  You should let your client know that well still send correspondence to the property if they chose it as their correspondence address, even if its being rented out.

  Rental income from renting out this property or part of it (for example, using a short-term letting arrangement) cant be considered for affordability. It should be deducted from the overall amount of rental income an applicant provides evidence of.

  We offer additional options if your clients want to let their property. See Permission to let for more information.

S.106 AGREEMENT (S.75 IN SCOTLAND)
----------------------------------
  The valuer must be able to value the property on a residential basis ignoring any possible business usage.

  Right to buy pre-emption clauses giving the council first rights for an onward sale within the first 10 years are acceptable.

  If the valuation is satisfactory then the property will constitute suitable security if ALL of the following requirements are also met:

  Restrictions on re-sale/disposal

  The S.106 agreement may stipulate that the Local authority has the right to nominate a buyer (meeting defined eligibility requirements) when the property is sold or disposed of.

  Discount market sales will typically have a S.106 present to ensure the discount remains for future sales, these are acceptable provided there is a mortgage in possession clause.

  Where the restriction includes a nomination period, these are acceptable provided the nomination period is no more than 3 months.

  UL LIST:
    • The maximum LTV is the lower of 80% of the open market value or 85% of the purchase price.
    • S.106 agreements must contain a mortgage exclusion clause to protect the mortgage in the event that the registered provider defaults.



TERM OF MORTGAGE - RESIDENTIAL
------------------------------
  For new interest-only mortgage customers, the term cant extend into retirement.

  Our usual mortgage term is between 5 and 40 years (25 for interest only, including part and part).

  Certain products also have specific requirements around their maximum mortgage term  for example, Family Springboard. See Lending products for more details about specific products.



TRANSACTION UNDER VALUE
-----------------------
  Transactions at undervalue can occur where a property is being or has been acquired by way of a Deed of Gift, or for less than the full market value. For such a transaction to be acceptable to Barclays the vendor must be a relative of the applicant or the applicants landlord.

  Where an Advisor is aware that a mortgage request is to be a transaction at undervalue, Mortgage Services must be notified at initial application stage to ensure the scenario is acceptable based on the above relationship requirements.

  In such cases problems may arise under the Insolvency Act 1986. Under Section 339 of the Insolvency Act 1986, a trustee in bankruptcy has the right to apply to the Courts to set aside a transaction at an undervalue, if the transferor subsequently becomes bankrupt within 5 years of the date of the transfer.

  The period during which the transfer can be set aside is reduced to 2 years if a Declaration of Solvency is obtained at the time of the transfer and the transferor does not become insolvent as a result of the transaction.

  Where it is confirmed that the applicant is purchasing their property at an undervalue as defined above, a minimum deposit of 5%, based on the lower of valuation or discounted purchase price, must be provided from the applicants own resources. It must be confirmed that the property being bought is not that being sold by a dependant relative who will then remain in the property after the sale takes place. If this is the case, then the application must be declined.

  The above deposit requirement does not apply to Springboard Mortgage transactions where a minimum 5% deposit is required based on lower of valuation and discounted purchase price with a further 10% cash deposit to be held in line with standard requirements applicable to a Springboard Mortgage Product.



VALUATION APPEALS
-----------------
  Customers can appeal against Valuations where the following apply

  For remortgages and further advance cases, where there is more than a 25% variance between the customers estimated value and the actual valuation provided by the Banks nominated valuer.

  For purchase cases, where there is a variance of more than 10% between the purchase price and the valuation.Appeals can only be considered when submitted against a physical valuation (i.e. not an AVM).

  This applies to both Residential and Buy to Let cases.

  Appeals can only be considered when submitted against a physical valuation (i.e. not an AVM).

  If your customer wishes to appeal the valuation in line with the guidance above, you will need to contact your Barclays Support Team or email mailto:brokersupport@barclays.com. An appeals form will be issued and you will be required to supply 3 comparable properties sold in the last 6 months.



VALUATIONS - RESIDENTIAL
------------------------
  To be able to lend on a property, Barclays requires a valuation to be carried out. When you apply for a Barclays mortgage, the valuation type depends on whether your mortgage will be on a residential or Buy to Let basis.

  The mortgage valuation is our standard report for all residential applications and includes a description of the property, an opinion of the market value of the property as at the date of inspection, and an estimate of the current cost to reinstate the property in its present form (where appropriate).

  Its important to remember that the mortgage valuation is a report which is primarily for Barclays purposes and confirms whether the property is suitable security for a mortgage  it is not a survey. As such, we ask that all clients consider instructing a separate survey to provide them with a more detailed assessment of the condition of the property, especially when an AVM has been accepted for lending purposes.

  Your client may wish to contact Countrywide Surveying Services on 0800 012 6995, e.surv Chartered Surveyors on 0800 169 9661, or any other provider to discuss the different survey options available. More information on the types of survey available can be seen found on the Home Surveys section of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors website.

  Please note that if your clients do instruct their own survey, this will be a separate contract between them and their chosen survey provider with separate fees applying. Barclays will always rely on the mortgage valuation for the purpose of agreeing the mortgage.

  Automated valuation model (AVM)

  For remortgages on properties up to £1m in value (up to £2m in London and South East), where the loan to value required is 80% (subject to product availability) or less. For purchases on properties up to £1m in value (up to £2m in London and South East), AVMs can be used on any LTV (subject to product availability). We use AVMs to assist with instant mortgage decisions. Whether you apply through MAX or via other online systems*, the use of AVMs will help speed up the decision and offer a better process for your customer. Where an AVM is not provided an alternative valuation will be undertaken. AVMs are only suitable for further borrowing where the latest valuation was a physical one and not an AVM. In all further borrowing cases where the latest valuation was an AVM, a Non-Disclosed PRA valuation must be requested. * For example, via MTE or Trigold.

GENERAL CONTENT:
----------------------------------------
UL LIST:
  • A-C A-C Additional borrowing Additional borrowing You need to treat requests for additional borrowing by existing mortgage customers as new lending, with the reason fully explained. Current policy rules apply to the combined total of the mortgage and additional lending. There are two exceptions to this (age and term) where policy requirements only apply to the additional amount borrowed. A maximum LTV of 85%* may be considered (subject to product availability). A maximum LTV of 80% applies where the purpose of additional borrowing (ie further advance) is for debt consolidation. * Maximum LTV for additional borrowing on interest only will depend on the repayment vehicle selected, see interest-only policy section. For all new lending requests a valuation must be carried out irrespective of when the original valuation was undertaken. Additional borrowing applications can exceed the term of the main mortgage account but must not exceed 40 years from the date the mortgage originally began, or 25 years for a mortgage with any element that is interest only. For Family Springboard mortgages, additional borrowing cant be taken while the deposit is locked, or exceed 35 years Interest only  the total new aggregate amount of interest-only borrowing, including any existing borrowing, must meet current interest-only standards, including for the repayment plan, plausibility assessment and minimum income requirements Repayment plan and LTV  changes in the repayment plan that the lending was already assessed against must meet the current interest-only standards. This applies whether the additional lending is on an interest-only or repayment basis For any applications involving the consolidation of an existing Mortgage Current Account Reserve debt, a condition of offer must be accepted by the customer that their Mortgage Current Account Reserve limit shall be reduced to zero/capped and any rebalancing feature should be switched off Additional borrowing is not allowed to support any demolish and re-build scenarios which are seen as a clear breach in Mortgage Terms & Conditions entered into by the borrower Since 16 October 2019, customers can only hold up to nine accounts in addition to their main mortgage. Additional borrowing on offset mortgages Clients who already have an offset mortgage with us and want to borrow more cant keep their current offset product. Theyll need to choose from one of these options, based on their circumstances. Keep the offset feature and borrow more against the same property. Youll need to submit an application for a new offset mortgage from our offset product range. The application needs to be for the total of the old mortgage balance plus the further borrowing (the total mortgage amount). Keep the offset feature and borrow more when buying a new property. Youll need to submit an application for the new total mortgage amount, selecting a product from our current offset range. Remove the offset feature and borrow more against the same property. Contact us for a bespoke rate switch product code, and you can submit an application to switch their mortgage to an equivalent, non-offset product on the same rate. Once complete, you can submit a new application for the additional borrowing. Remove the offset feature and port the mortgage to a new property. If your client wants to keep their current rate when moving and borrow more, but no longer needs the offset feature, contact us for a bespoke product code. Well port their current rate to an equivalent, non-offset product on the same rate. Adverse credit history  Residential Adverse credit history  Residential County Court Judgements (CCJs/defaults) Adverse credit as detailed below must be declined: Any unsatisfied CCJ More than 1 satisfied CCJ and the latest is registered within the past 3 years Satisfied CCJs totalling more than £200 and the latest is registered within the past 3 years More than 3 satisfied defaults* and the latest is registered within the past 3 years Satisfied defaults* totalling more than £200 and the latest is registered within the past 3 years Any outstanding default, irrespective of amount If it is identified that a limited company, in which an applicant has greater than 15% shareholding, has any outstanding judgements totalling more than £5,000 *Includes partially settled defaults which will be referred out to check whether full and final settlement has been made Applications can be considered where the above is identified but only where documentary evidence of a settled dispute has been provided by the customer. Payment Arrears/Missed Payments Application must be declined if any of the following apply: The applicant has had three or more months of missed payments (secured or unsecured) in the last two years, even if those months werent in a row. The applicant has had two or more months arrears on any one account in the last six months. Payment Arrangements If payment arrangements are identified in the credit search which are still running or have ended less than 1 year prior to the time of application, the case must be declined. Over-indebtedness Where the total unsecured bureau debt (credit cards, overdrafts and loans) is greater than or equal to the gross annual income used in the affordability assessment then the application will be declined. This includes where customers were looking to consolidate the borrowing on to the mortgage. These standards only apply on drawn balances (unused credit limits are not included). This calculation is automatically applied by the system. Mortgage or rent arrears If arrears of more than 1 month have occurred in the past 6 months, and/or 3 months arrears have occurred in the past 2 years, the case is outside lending policy and is to be declined. However, this decision could be changed if there is an acceptable technical reason, or if evidence of a settled dispute is provided and verified by the lender. If this is the case, please contact our Intermediary Mortgage Experts on 0345 073 3330 * to discuss whether we will be able to assist. Lines are open Monday to Friday 9am-5pm. Bankruptcy/IVA It is not acceptable to lend where any applicant is currently bankrupt or subject to a Debt Relief Order (DRO) and/or Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA) however, lending can be considered provided any bankruptcy, DRO or IVA was registered more than 6 years ago from the date of submission (and hence no longer appears on the credit reference bureau information). If your client has a more complex credit history? You may wish to visit Kensington Mortgages, one of the UKs leading specialist lenders and a subsidiary of Barclays Bank UK PLC. Kensington offer more flexible lending criteria to help people who may not meet typical lending requirements. Learn more. Affordability  Residential Affordability  Residential It is important that we demonstrate that an applicant can reasonably afford to repay their mortgage before we agree to enter into a regulated mortgage contract with them. The use of income multiples alone is not sufficient to assess the maximum amount well lend. Your clients affordability will also be assessed using information collected in the Affording your Mortgage section of our application. Here, youll need to detail their regular financial commitments to show that they can afford to make the required monthly repayments. There are several factors to take into account when assessing your clients ability to repay their mortgage Income assessment This should include the applicants actual verified income, net of tax and National Insurance. When making a lending decision or contract variation the underwriters can consider various sources of income (please see the requirements table). The underwriter must consider the variability of the income over time to ensure the mortgage payments remain affordable to the customer. Variable (or non-guaranteed income) must be verified over a sufficient period to inform an assessment of sustainability. Expenditure assessment The data captured in the application must take into account committed expenditure (eg credit cards, overdraft, council tax, loans, hire purchase, school fees). Basic essential expenditure and basic quality of living costs will be accounted for in the affordability model. Monthly mortgage commitment The monthly repayment must be met from the applicants actual or reasonably anticipated income. If the applicant intends to repay from resources other than income, reference to information given by the applicant must be given on the application form. For repayment mortgages The monthly repayment used in affordability must be calculated on a capital and interest repayment basis. This should be based on the applicants current affordability rate or pay rate, whichever is higher. This should also be based on the term of the mortgage or until the applicant is 70, or at the normal retirement of the principal applicant (main income earner), whichever is sooner. For any repayment mortgage term greater than 35 years and up to 40 years, a maximum term of 35 years would be applied for affordability purposes. For interest only mortgages The monthly repayment used in affordability must be calculated on a capital and interest repayment basis at the current affordability rate or pay rate, whichever is higher. This should be over an assumed term of 25 years or until the applicant is 70 or at the normal retirement of all applicants, whichever is sooner. Please note, for interest only mortgages the maximum term is 25 years. Where income into retirement from any applicant is required to meet affordability, it is not acceptable to lend on an interest-only basis. Second or subsequent properties Second or subsequent properties: commitments in the form of mortgage payments on second properties, other than those on properties confirmed as Buy to Let or Permission to Let properties, will be automatically applied on a standard repayment basis over the outstanding mortgage term at the current affordability rate or current payment amount, whichever is the higher when assessing affordability. Where a credit limit applies to the existing mortgage borrowing, then it is this figure, including any undrawn monies, that should be used when assessing affordability. In addition, a fixed-value commitment for each additional mortgaged residential property held is applied by the system to cover all other costs  this only applies to other residential properties, i.e. second residential homes, but not any property confirmed as being on a Buy to Let or Permission to Let basis. The running costs (e.g. home insurance, utilities and council tax) of any residential unencumbered properties need to be included in the affordability assessment  please manually enter figures on the Commitments screen. Buy-to-let/ Permission-to-let properties: Commitments in the form of contractual monthly mortgage payments on background buy to let/ permission to let properties will be applied automatically. Remaining disposable income The applicants disposable income  ie, their monthly income after accounting for regular commitments as detailed above, must be sufficient to cover all other general living expenses, eg food, clothing, utility bills, hobbies. Disposable income requirements are set by Barclays and must be met in all instances. Where these levels of disposable income are not realised, the application will be declined. Age/Term Age/Term Minimum age: 18 Maximum age at the end of the mortgage term cannot exceed the oldest applicants 80th birthday. Our maximum acceptable retirement age is 75, please note when the retirement age exceeds 70 our underwriting team may review the application and require additional information. Where the mortgage term will go beyond age 75 proof of pension income must be provided, where the applicants income is required for affordability. Youll need to submit documents to prove affordability for the full mortgage term. Our underwriters will need to see documents that show your client will be able to keep up with their mortgage payments when theyve retired. Youll also need to confirm that youve discussed affordability in retirement with your client, and that theyre comfortable theyll be able to meet the mortgage repayments until the end of the mortgage term. We can consider applications on an interest-only basis up to age 75. However, affordability must be demonstrated up to age 70. For repayment mortgages, terms may extend beyond 75 either where a younger applicant meets the affordability requirements or where customers can show evidence that theyll be able to pay the mortgage in retirement. Armed forces personnel Armed forces personnel UK Armed Forces Personnel who are currently working in the UK or overseas and wish to buy/re-mortgage a property to let, that is intended to be their main residence in the future or on their eventual return to the UK. It is acceptable to let the mortgage property on an Assured Shorthold Tenancy basis. Service Personnel may be offered a Forces Help To Buy Loan (FHTB), which replaces the Long Service Advance of Pay (LSAP). This is usually a 10-year interest-free loan of up to £25,000. This may be used as a deposit to purchase a property but should be treated as a loan commitment in the normal way, with the annual monthly payments being deducted from the applicants income. Please see the Help to Buy  Forces Help to Buy policy section for further details.

Monthly Bonus Identify if monthly* bonus is on the most recent 3 months* payslips Well never use less than 50% of the most recent 3 months average Average the total monthly bonus amounts from the last 3 months* payslips and use the same payslips to compare the annualised figure against the P60 Youll need to deduct the salary, allowances and any bonus payments that are less frequent than monthly (or more) when reviewing a P60 and calculating the monthly bonus The remaining figure should then be divided by 12 to show the monthly average from the P60 Take the lower of the following 2 figures (unless the minimum 50% applies) 100% of the 3 months average 100% of the latest P60 monthly average *If frequency of pay is not monthly (e.g. bi weekly / 4 weekly / weekly), Please see weekly, 2-weekly or 4-weekly section below. Annual Bonus Youll need to use the gross (pre-tax) bonus figure when calculating your customers bonuses. Bonuses paid less frequently than monthly are classed as annual Bonuses paid monthly or more frequently are classed as monthly* * See Monthly Bonus section for further details Note - Your customer is not required to have been with the same employer for 2 years, however, the most recent annual bonus must have been paid by their current employer and, in all cases, must have been paid within the last 12 months. An annual bonus can be considered where it has only been paid in the most recent year. Payslips The number of payslips required is dependent on the frequency of the bonus. We need evidence of their annual bonus over the last 2 years. If your customer receives their bonus Quarterly then we need 8 payslips which evidence the bonus payment If your customer receives their bonus Half Yearly then we need 4 payslips which evidence the bonus payment If your customer receives their bonus Annually then we need 2 payslips which evidence the bonus payment Note - You can use the payslips to show annual bonuses over the last 2 years (We dont need P60s to validate, and we require no additional calculations). P60s Where your customer cant provide the required payslips, we need to confirm the annual bonus is sustainable using the last 2 years P60s. P60s are only acceptable where the customer is not also in receipt of regular bonus, overtime or commission. Obtain the P60s to confirm bonus over the last 2 years. Calculate the annual bonus figure for both years If the latest years bonus figure is lower than the previous years, you can only use the latest years figure. If it is higher than the previous years you can use an average of the two years Calculate Overtime or commission Identify if monthly* overtime/commission is showing on at least 1 of the most recent 3 months* payslips Average the total monthly* overtime/commission amounts from the last 3 months* payslips and use the same payslips to compare the annualised figure against the P60 Youll need to deduct the salary, allowances and any bonus payments that are less frequent than monthly (or more) when reviewing a P60 and calculating the monthly overtime/commission The remaining figure should then be divided by 12 to show the monthly average from the P60 Take the lower of the following 2 figures (unless the minimum 50% applies) 100% of the 3 months average 100% of the latest P60 monthly average **If frequency of pay is not monthly (e.g. bi weekly / 4 weekly / weekly), see weekly, 2-weekly or 4-weekly section below Examples Example 1 (evidenced on 3 consecutive most recent payslips) Basic = £20,000 - Monthly bonus (average over last 3 months) = £1,000 - P60 Total income = £23,000 Bonus amount (P60 value) = £3,000 (divided by 12 = £250 per month) Monthly bonus Figure to use = £500 per month Decision - As the P60 monthly average value after basic salary is deducted is less than 50% of the latest 3 payslips, the figure added to application is £500 per month (50% current average monthly bonus = £1,000 x 50%) Example 2 (evidenced on at least 1 out of 3 recent payslips) Basic annual income = £20,000 - Monthly overtime (average over last 3 months) = £1,000 per month - P60 Total annual income = £29,000 Less Basic annual income = £20,000 Overtime amount (P60 average value) = £9,000 (divided by 12 = £750 per month) Overtime Figure to use = £750 per month Decision - As the P60 monthly average value after basic salary is deducted is lower than 100% of the average of the latest 3 payslips, the figure added to MAX is £750 per month (use the lower of the 2 averages) Example 3 (evidenced on at least 1 out of 3 recent payslips) Basic annual income = £20,000 - Commission (average over last 3 months) = £1,000 per month - P60 Total annual income = £38,000 Less Basic annual income = £20,000 Commission amount (P60 average value) = £18,000 (divided by 12 = £1,500 per month) Commission Figure to use = £1,000 Decision - As the P60 monthly average value after basic salary is deducted is higher than 100% of average of the latest 3 payslips, the figure added to MAX is £1,000 per month (use the lower of the 2 averages) If income Then* Monthly Use latest months payslip figure 4-weekly Use latest months payslip figure Multiply this figure by 13 (for annual figure) Divide annual figure by 12 2-weekly Total figures from last 3 payslips Divide this by 6 (for averaged weekly pay) Multiply this by 52 (for annual figure) Divide this by 12 (for equivalent monthly figure) Weekly Total the figures from last 5 payslips Divide this figure by 5 (for averaged weekly figure) Multiply the average weekly figure by 52 (for annual figure) Divide annual figure by 12 Non-cash compensation Customers may choose to have their bonus payment paid into alternate places instead of having it paid cash. E.g. their pension or share scheme etc. This can still be used toward affordability when assessing a mortgage application. Where shares are a feature of an applicants total income awarded by their employer (e.g. in the form of restricted stock units (RSUs) that are subject to a vesting schedule) this cannot be considered standard income in the affordability assessment for retail mortgage applications Cladding/The Building Safety Act 2022 Cladding/The Building Safety Act 2022 The Building Safety Act 2022 provides protection from the remediation costs of replacing external combustible material where there is an agreed approach to remediation in place. Buildings that have external wall systems may require an EWS1 rating. Where a rating is A3 OR B2 this indicates some form of remediation is required. There are a variety of options available to leaseholders and Barclays made a commitment to help customers living in or buying impacted properties where there is a qualifying lease or planned remediation in place by a recognised body. To support applications for impacted properties that require remediation we will need one of the following to be provided to us with your clients mortgage application. Written confirmation of intention to complete the works from a developer who has signed a contact with the government. You can see a full list of developers who have signed the pledge on .GOV.UK A Building Safety Act 2022 Government Leaseholder Deed of Certificate Form accompanied by a Building Safety Act 2022 Landlords Certificate Written confirmation from a housing association confirming they are completing the remediation or written confirmation from DLUHC confirming the property is approved for funding to remediate. For letters from DLUHC, these should clearly state if any financial liability is passed to the leaseholder or be accompanied by a leaseholder or landlord certificate. Where your client provides the Landlord and Leaseholder certificates it is important to capture the financial commitment they will have. You can find the total sum payable on the landlord certificate within the work undertaken on relevant defects section. Any amount the client must pay will be taken over a 10-year period. Therefore, the amount due on Monday 14th February 2022, should be divided by 120 months and captured as or within the service charge to ensure affordability is met. Developer or Housing Association remediated properties will have no financial liability passed to the leaseholder and therefore will not impact affordability. Please note: if the application is for a property that requires fire safety remediation we will only proceed where we have satisfactory evidence in the format/s detailed above. In the event this cannot be provided we would be unable to support your customers mortgage application at this time. For customers who already hold their mortgage with Barclays against a property that requires remediation we can support rate switch applications, permission to let requests and conversion from BTL to residential or vice versa without evidence being required. Where any additional borrowing is required for existing customers, the rules detailed would apply. Commitments  Residential Commitments  Residential The monthly amount to be paid towards the following commitments (including those originated and/or operated outside of the UK) must be deducted from the applicant/s net income to prove affordability: Hire Purchase Agreements including Mail Order Payments, Bank Loans, Finance Loans, Payday Loan Advances (full amount outstanding applies) or Second Charges Future Commitments - commitments that become due during the term of the mortgage must be included in the affordability assessment. This includes deferred credit payments and delayed payments and should be entered in the deferred credit dropdown box on the financial commitments page on the mortgage application system In addition to being included in the Special Scheme information in Borrowing Requirements, all Shared Equity loan balances, including England & Wales Help to Buy Equity loans, must be recorded within Financial Commitments under Shared Equity if interest is due within the mortgage term. The system will then take 3% per annum of the outstanding balance of the loan as a commitment for affordability. Please note: only in circumstances where no interest is due on the shared equity loan at any stage within the mortgage term (such as the Scotland HTB equity scheme) or the equity loan is being paid off in full as part of the application, should the equity loan not be recorded as a Financial Commitment If repaying part of an interest charging equity loan, these should be input as two Shared Equity commitments  one for the Shared Equity loan balance to be repaid (marked to be repaid) and one for the Shared Equity loan balance to remain (marked not to be repaid) Second or subsequent properties: commitments in the form of mortgage payments on second properties, other than those on properties confirmed as Buy to Let or Permission to Let properties, will automatically be applied on a standard repayment basis over the outstanding mortgage term at the current affordability rate or current payment amount, whichever is the higher when assessing affordability. Where a credit limit applies to the existing mortgage borrowing, then it is this figure, including any undrawn monies, that should be used when assessing affordability. In addition, a fixed-value commitment for each additional mortgaged residential property held is applied by the system to cover all other costs  this only applies to other residential properties, i.e. second residential homes, but not any property confirmed as being on a Buy to Let or Permission to Let basis. Buy to let/ Permission to let properties: Commitments in the form of contractual monthly mortgage payments on background buy to let/ permission to let properties will be applied automatically The running costs of any unencumbered second property need to be included in the affordability assessment  please manually enter figures on the Commitments screen. This should include Gas and electricity Water House insurance Council tax Ground rent/service charge Guarantors: If a customer is a guarantor for any mortgage, property rental agreement, secured loan or any other loans then the monthly payment of such commitments is applied in the affordability assessment in line with the above requirements Regular Pension Payments  including any additional voluntary payments (such as AVCs) being paid regularly from income. One-off contributions  for example from an annual bonus  can be disregarded (pension contributions will be calculated automatically as part of the affordability assessment. They shouldnt be input as part of the application process) The cost of any bridging loan Court orders relating to maintenance payments or judgement debts Child Support Agency (CSA) payments School fees and child care costs Current monthly student loan payment Liability for ground rent, service and maintenance charges under any leasehold, commonhold or other agreement  including any equity sharing agreements Credit card debts (at the rate of 3% of the debt outstanding) including store cards Overdraft debts (at the rate of 3% of the drawn balance at the time of application) Council tax Shared equity loan or shared ownership rent Foreign Credit Commitments - Where a mortgage applicant has any credit commitment denominated in a currency other than GBP, this will be converted to sterling using Barclays Foreign Note Rate including balance and regular payments. This will be completed on the day the initial decision is obtained (i.e DIP 1) Other considerations Any loan/fixed repayment debt with less than 6 months to run can be ignored, provided that the total balance of loans in this category does not exceed £1,000 The total amount outstanding against any payday loan advance must be deducted from the applicants net income when assessing affordability Any commitment which is to be repaid from the new proposed mortgage advance can be ignored provided a specific offer condition is made to this effect Any unpaid tax evidenced from the HMRC tax overview document must be treated as a commitment in the period it falls due Where an applicant is in receipt of benefit income, please ensure any associated regular costs incurred by the customer  for which this benefit income is intended  is included as a commitment. For example, if the applicant is claiming Personal Independence Payments (PIP), it may be appropriate to record any regular care costs. Notes: If any undeclared commitment is identified this will generate a remodelling of the application and potentially a change in lending decision. Contract workers Contract workers Our policy on applicants who are contractors depends on if they are working on an employed or self-employed basis. Applicants employed in professional roles where contracts are provided on a fixed term basis, but each contract rolls to the next placement and so the overarching employment does not change (i.e. Junior Doctors, Teachers, Junior Solicitors), should be keyed as employed. These roles will all receive a salary. All contractors There can be no more than a 6-week gap between contracts Evidence of 12 months contracts (a minimum of 2 contracts must be provided if latest contract covers <12 months) is required  the only exception is where the applicant has recently moved from employee to contractor and provides services to their previous employer: In this case, we require confirmation that the client employed the applicant for at least 3 years before they became a contractor along with a copy of the service contract showing terms of remuneration, duration of contract and conditions of cancellation or termination There must be 3 months remaining on their current contract or alternatively be able to provide evidence of the next one Umbrella, Agency or Fixed Term contractors The following policy applies to contract workers who are employed on a PAYE basis (e.g. via an umbrella company or agency): Income is calculated on an employed basis using 3 months (or equivalent) pay slips, and taking an average where necessary, any holiday pay received is included within the average. Where the customer has any form of variable pay or bonus this should be calculated using employed policy. Applications for contractors in occupations such as professional sport will be assessed on a case-by-case basis to check for sustainability and plausibility. By recording these types of customer on the application as Employed - Fixed Term Contract this will ensure these checks can take place. Self-employed contractors For contract workers operating on a self-employed basis affordability calculations will depend on how their business is structured. Where ALL of the following additional requirements are met a daily rate calculation may be applied The firm is a limited company The firm does not employ anyone (other than the applicant(s) themselves) The applicant(s) collectively own 100% shares The applicants current contract equates to at least £218 per day or £50,000 per year (gross) Mortgage Loan-to-Value is  90% Daily-rate calculation To calculate gross income, you will Identify the lower of the following  Average Daily Rate of Pay (excl. VAT) from the 2 most recent contracts OR the most recent Daily Rate of Pay (excl. VAT) OR the actual income shown on the bank statements; then multiple by 5 and; then multiple by 46 to give the annual figure If the contract expresses pay as an hourly-rate, then the applicants income should be calculated on the assumption there are a maximum of 40 working hours per week, unless the contract or the applicant specifies a lower number of hours. The resulting weekly amount should then be multiplied by 46 working weeks to arrive at the gross annual income for affordability purposes. Additional commitments (where daily-rate is used) - When the daily-rate calculation is being used; credit commitments for which the limited company is liable/responsible (e.g. business loans, including bounce back loans) should be recorded within the application and considered as part of the overall affordability assessment. On the application, the monthly payment should be entered as shown on the business bank statements, the outstanding balance detailed as £1 and the remaining term as 1y 0m. The following additional documents are required if the daily-rate calculation is being applied Latest 3 full months consecutive personal bank statements confirming receipt of income Latest 3 full months consecutive business bank statements confirming receipt of income All contractors using the daily rate should be recorded on the application as Employed - Fixed Term Contract. Contractors not employed via an umbrella or agency or that do not meet the daily rate criteria must document income following our self-employed policy. Please refer to our self-employed and allowable income sections for further details. Credit reference searches Credit reference searches A full personal credit check will be undertaken on each applicant.

Cryptoassets Cryptoassets You should make us aware if any portion of the customers income or source of wealth is cryptoasset-based or consists of investments in a crypto-related software business (e.g. Blockchain/DLT Tech firms). Cryptoassets can include cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin), utility tokens (unregulated cryptoassets usually issued as part of an ICO/ITO), asset tokens including stable coins (asset-backed coins with a value pegged to a physical asset of some kind) and security tokens. Applications of this nature will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
  • Additional borrowing Additional borrowing You need to treat requests for additional borrowing by existing mortgage customers as new lending, with the reason fully explained. Current policy rules apply to the combined total of the mortgage and additional lending. There are two exceptions to this (age and term) where policy requirements only apply to the additional amount borrowed. A maximum LTV of 85%* may be considered (subject to product availability). A maximum LTV of 80% applies where the purpose of additional borrowing (ie further advance) is for debt consolidation. * Maximum LTV for additional borrowing on interest only will depend on the repayment vehicle selected, see interest-only policy section. For all new lending requests a valuation must be carried out irrespective of when the original valuation was undertaken. Additional borrowing applications can exceed the term of the main mortgage account but must not exceed 40 years from the date the mortgage originally began, or 25 years for a mortgage with any element that is interest only. For Family Springboard mortgages, additional borrowing cant be taken while the deposit is locked, or exceed 35 years Interest only  the total new aggregate amount of interest-only borrowing, including any existing borrowing, must meet current interest-only standards, including for the repayment plan, plausibility assessment and minimum income requirements Repayment plan and LTV  changes in the repayment plan that the lending was already assessed against must meet the current interest-only standards. This applies whether the additional lending is on an interest-only or repayment basis For any applications involving the consolidation of an existing Mortgage Current Account Reserve debt, a condition of offer must be accepted by the customer that their Mortgage Current Account Reserve limit shall be reduced to zero/capped and any rebalancing feature should be switched off Additional borrowing is not allowed to support any demolish and re-build scenarios which are seen as a clear breach in Mortgage Terms & Conditions entered into by the borrower Since 16 October 2019, customers can only hold up to nine accounts in addition to their main mortgage. Additional borrowing on offset mortgages Clients who already have an offset mortgage with us and want to borrow more cant keep their current offset product. Theyll need to choose from one of these options, based on their circumstances. Keep the offset feature and borrow more against the same property. Youll need to submit an application for a new offset mortgage from our offset product range. The application needs to be for the total of the old mortgage balance plus the further borrowing (the total mortgage amount). Keep the offset feature and borrow more when buying a new property. Youll need to submit an application for the new total mortgage amount, selecting a product from our current offset range. Remove the offset feature and borrow more against the same property. Contact us for a bespoke rate switch product code, and you can submit an application to switch their mortgage to an equivalent, non-offset product on the same rate. Once complete, you can submit a new application for the additional borrowing. Remove the offset feature and port the mortgage to a new property. If your client wants to keep their current rate when moving and borrow more, but no longer needs the offset feature, contact us for a bespoke product code. Well port their current rate to an equivalent, non-offset product on the same rate.

  • Adverse credit history  Residential Adverse credit history  Residential County Court Judgements (CCJs/defaults) Adverse credit as detailed below must be declined: Any unsatisfied CCJ More than 1 satisfied CCJ and the latest is registered within the past 3 years Satisfied CCJs totalling more than £200 and the latest is registered within the past 3 years More than 3 satisfied defaults* and the latest is registered within the past 3 years Satisfied defaults* totalling more than £200 and the latest is registered within the past 3 years Any outstanding default, irrespective of amount If it is identified that a limited company, in which an applicant has greater than 15% shareholding, has any outstanding judgements totalling more than £5,000 *Includes partially settled defaults which will be referred out to check whether full and final settlement has been made Applications can be considered where the above is identified but only where documentary evidence of a settled dispute has been provided by the customer. Payment Arrears/Missed Payments Application must be declined if any of the following apply: The applicant has had three or more months of missed payments (secured or unsecured) in the last two years, even if those months werent in a row. The applicant has had two or more months arrears on any one account in the last six months. Payment Arrangements If payment arrangements are identified in the credit search which are still running or have ended less than 1 year prior to the time of application, the case must be declined. Over-indebtedness Where the total unsecured bureau debt (credit cards, overdrafts and loans) is greater than or equal to the gross annual income used in the affordability assessment then the application will be declined. This includes where customers were looking to consolidate the borrowing on to the mortgage. These standards only apply on drawn balances (unused credit limits are not included). This calculation is automatically applied by the system. Mortgage or rent arrears If arrears of more than 1 month have occurred in the past 6 months, and/or 3 months arrears have occurred in the past 2 years, the case is outside lending policy and is to be declined. However, this decision could be changed if there is an acceptable technical reason, or if evidence of a settled dispute is provided and verified by the lender. If this is the case, please contact our Intermediary Mortgage Experts on 0345 073 3330 * to discuss whether we will be able to assist. Lines are open Monday to Friday 9am-5pm. Bankruptcy/IVA It is not acceptable to lend where any applicant is currently bankrupt or subject to a Debt Relief Order (DRO) and/or Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA) however, lending can be considered provided any bankruptcy, DRO or IVA was registered more than 6 years ago from the date of submission (and hence no longer appears on the credit reference bureau information).

  • Affordability  Residential Affordability  Residential It is important that we demonstrate that an applicant can reasonably afford to repay their mortgage before we agree to enter into a regulated mortgage contract with them. The use of income multiples alone is not sufficient to assess the maximum amount well lend. Your clients affordability will also be assessed using information collected in the Affording your Mortgage section of our application. Here, youll need to detail their regular financial commitments to show that they can afford to make the required monthly repayments. There are several factors to take into account when assessing your clients ability to repay their mortgage Income assessment This should include the applicants actual verified income, net of tax and National Insurance. When making a lending decision or contract variation the underwriters can consider various sources of income (please see the requirements table). The underwriter must consider the variability of the income over time to ensure the mortgage payments remain affordable to the customer. Variable (or non-guaranteed income) must be verified over a sufficient period to inform an assessment of sustainability. Expenditure assessment The data captured in the application must take into account committed expenditure (eg credit cards, overdraft, council tax, loans, hire purchase, school fees). Basic essential expenditure and basic quality of living costs will be accounted for in the affordability model. Monthly mortgage commitment The monthly repayment must be met from the applicants actual or reasonably anticipated income. If the applicant intends to repay from resources other than income, reference to information given by the applicant must be given on the application form. For repayment mortgages The monthly repayment used in affordability must be calculated on a capital and interest repayment basis. This should be based on the applicants current affordability rate or pay rate, whichever is higher. This should also be based on the term of the mortgage or until the applicant is 70, or at the normal retirement of the principal applicant (main income earner), whichever is sooner. For any repayment mortgage term greater than 35 years and up to 40 years, a maximum term of 35 years would be applied for affordability purposes. For interest only mortgages The monthly repayment used in affordability must be calculated on a capital and interest repayment basis at the current affordability rate or pay rate, whichever is higher. This should be over an assumed term of 25 years or until the applicant is 70 or at the normal retirement of all applicants, whichever is sooner. Please note, for interest only mortgages the maximum term is 25 years. Where income into retirement from any applicant is required to meet affordability, it is not acceptable to lend on an interest-only basis. Second or subsequent properties Second or subsequent properties: commitments in the form of mortgage payments on second properties, other than those on properties confirmed as Buy to Let or Permission to Let properties, will be automatically applied on a standard repayment basis over the outstanding mortgage term at the current affordability rate or current payment amount, whichever is the higher when assessing affordability. Where a credit limit applies to the existing mortgage borrowing, then it is this figure, including any undrawn monies, that should be used when assessing affordability. In addition, a fixed-value commitment for each additional mortgaged residential property held is applied by the system to cover all other costs  this only applies to other residential properties, i.e. second residential homes, but not any property confirmed as being on a Buy to Let or Permission to Let basis. The running costs (e.g. home insurance, utilities and council tax) of any residential unencumbered properties need to be included in the affordability assessment  please manually enter figures on the Commitments screen. Buy-to-let/ Permission-to-let properties: Commitments in the form of contractual monthly mortgage payments on background buy to let/ permission to let properties will be applied automatically. Remaining disposable income The applicants disposable income  ie, their monthly income after accounting for regular commitments as detailed above, must be sufficient to cover all other general living expenses, eg food, clothing, utility bills, hobbies. Disposable income requirements are set by Barclays and must be met in all instances. Where these levels of disposable income are not realised, the application will be declined.
  • Age/Term Age/Term Minimum age: 18 Maximum age at the end of the mortgage term cannot exceed the oldest applicants 80th birthday. Our maximum acceptable retirement age is 75, please note when the retirement age exceeds 70 our underwriting team may review the application and require additional information. Where the mortgage term will go beyond age 75 proof of pension income must be provided, where the applicants income is required for affordability. Youll need to submit documents to prove affordability for the full mortgage term. Our underwriters will need to see documents that show your client will be able to keep up with their mortgage payments when theyve retired. Youll also need to confirm that youve discussed affordability in retirement with your client, and that theyre comfortable theyll be able to meet the mortgage repayments until the end of the mortgage term. We can consider applications on an interest-only basis up to age 75. However, affordability must be demonstrated up to age 70. For repayment mortgages, terms may extend beyond 75 either where a younger applicant meets the affordability requirements or where customers can show evidence that theyll be able to pay the mortgage in retirement.
  • Armed forces personnel Armed forces personnel UK Armed Forces Personnel who are currently working in the UK or overseas and wish to buy/re-mortgage a property to let, that is intended to be their main residence in the future or on their eventual return to the UK. It is acceptable to let the mortgage property on an Assured Shorthold Tenancy basis. Service Personnel may be offered a Forces Help To Buy Loan (FHTB), which replaces the Long Service Advance of Pay (LSAP). This is usually a 10-year interest-free loan of up to £25,000. This may be used as a deposit to purchase a property but should be treated as a loan commitment in the normal way, with the annual monthly payments being deducted from the applicants income. Please see the Help to Buy  Forces Help to Buy policy section for further details.

Monthly Bonus Identify if monthly* bonus is on the most recent 3 months* payslips Well never use less than 50% of the most recent 3 months average Average the total monthly bonus amounts from the last 3 months* payslips and use the same payslips to compare the annualised figure against the P60 Youll need to deduct the salary, allowances and any bonus payments that are less frequent than monthly (or more) when reviewing a P60 and calculating the monthly bonus The remaining figure should then be divided by 12 to show the monthly average from the P60 Take the lower of the following 2 figures (unless the minimum 50% applies) 100% of the 3 months average 100% of the latest P60 monthly average *If frequency of pay is not monthly (e.g. bi weekly / 4 weekly / weekly), Please see weekly, 2-weekly or 4-weekly section below. Annual Bonus Youll need to use the gross (pre-tax) bonus figure when calculating your customers bonuses. Bonuses paid less frequently than monthly are classed as annual Bonuses paid monthly or more frequently are classed as monthly* * See Monthly Bonus section for further details Note - Your customer is not required to have been with the same employer for 2 years, however, the most recent annual bonus must have been paid by their current employer and, in all cases, must have been paid within the last 12 months. An annual bonus can be considered where it has only been paid in the most recent year. Payslips The number of payslips required is dependent on the frequency of the bonus. We need evidence of their annual bonus over the last 2 years. If your customer receives their bonus Quarterly then we need 8 payslips which evidence the bonus payment If your customer receives their bonus Half Yearly then we need 4 payslips which evidence the bonus payment If your customer receives their bonus Annually then we need 2 payslips which evidence the bonus payment Note - You can use the payslips to show annual bonuses over the last 2 years (We dont need P60s to validate, and we require no additional calculations). P60s Where your customer cant provide the required payslips, we need to confirm the annual bonus is sustainable using the last 2 years P60s. P60s are only acceptable where the customer is not also in receipt of regular bonus, overtime or commission. Obtain the P60s to confirm bonus over the last 2 years. Calculate the annual bonus figure for both years If the latest years bonus figure is lower than the previous years, you can only use the latest years figure. If it is higher than the previous years you can use an average of the two years Calculate Overtime or commission Identify if monthly* overtime/commission is showing on at least 1 of the most recent 3 months* payslips Average the total monthly* overtime/commission amounts from the last 3 months* payslips and use the same payslips to compare the annualised figure against the P60 Youll need to deduct the salary, allowances and any bonus payments that are less frequent than monthly (or more) when reviewing a P60 and calculating the monthly overtime/commission The remaining figure should then be divided by 12 to show the monthly average from the P60 Take the lower of the following 2 figures (unless the minimum 50% applies) 100% of the 3 months average 100% of the latest P60 monthly average **If frequency of pay is not monthly (e.g. bi weekly / 4 weekly / weekly), see weekly, 2-weekly or 4-weekly section below Examples Example 1 (evidenced on 3 consecutive most recent payslips) Basic = £20,000 - Monthly bonus (average over last 3 months) = £1,000 - P60 Total income = £23,000 Bonus amount (P60 value) = £3,000 (divided by 12 = £250 per month) Monthly bonus Figure to use = £500 per month Decision - As the P60 monthly average value after basic salary is deducted is less than 50% of the latest 3 payslips, the figure added to application is £500 per month (50% current average monthly bonus = £1,000 x 50%) Example 2 (evidenced on at least 1 out of 3 recent payslips) Basic annual income = £20,000 - Monthly overtime (average over last 3 months) = £1,000 per month - P60 Total annual income = £29,000 Less Basic annual income = £20,000 Overtime amount (P60 average value) = £9,000 (divided by 12 = £750 per month) Overtime Figure to use = £750 per month Decision - As the P60 monthly average value after basic salary is deducted is lower than 100% of the average of the latest 3 payslips, the figure added to MAX is £750 per month (use the lower of the 2 averages) Example 3 (evidenced on at least 1 out of 3 recent payslips) Basic annual income = £20,000 - Commission (average over last 3 months) = £1,000 per month - P60 Total annual income = £38,000 Less Basic annual income = £20,000 Commission amount (P60 average value) = £18,000 (divided by 12 = £1,500 per month) Commission Figure to use = £1,000 Decision - As the P60 monthly average value after basic salary is deducted is higher than 100% of average of the latest 3 payslips, the figure added to MAX is £1,000 per month (use the lower of the 2 averages) If income Then* Monthly Use latest months payslip figure 4-weekly Use latest months payslip figure Multiply this figure by 13 (for annual figure) Divide annual figure by 12 2-weekly Total figures from last 3 payslips Divide this by 6 (for averaged weekly pay) Multiply this by 52 (for annual figure) Divide this by 12 (for equivalent monthly figure) Weekly Total the figures from last 5 payslips Divide this figure by 5 (for averaged weekly figure) Multiply the average weekly figure by 52 (for annual figure) Divide annual figure by 12 Non-cash compensation Customers may choose to have their bonus payment paid into alternate places instead of having it paid cash. E.g. their pension or share scheme etc. This can still be used toward affordability when assessing a mortgage application. Where shares are a feature of an applicants total income awarded by their employer (e.g. in the form of restricted stock units (RSUs) that are subject to a vesting schedule) this cannot be considered standard income in the affordability assessment for retail mortgage applications

  • Cladding/The Building Safety Act 2022 Cladding/The Building Safety Act 2022 The Building Safety Act 2022 provides protection from the remediation costs of replacing external combustible material where there is an agreed approach to remediation in place. Buildings that have external wall systems may require an EWS1 rating. Where a rating is A3 OR B2 this indicates some form of remediation is required. There are a variety of options available to leaseholders and Barclays made a commitment to help customers living in or buying impacted properties where there is a qualifying lease or planned remediation in place by a recognised body. To support applications for impacted properties that require remediation we will need one of the following to be provided to us with your clients mortgage application. Written confirmation of intention to complete the works from a developer who has signed a contact with the government. You can see a full list of developers who have signed the pledge on .GOV.UK A Building Safety Act 2022 Government Leaseholder Deed of Certificate Form accompanied by a Building Safety Act 2022 Landlords Certificate Written confirmation from a housing association confirming they are completing the remediation or written confirmation from DLUHC confirming the property is approved for funding to remediate. For letters from DLUHC, these should clearly state if any financial liability is passed to the leaseholder or be accompanied by a leaseholder or landlord certificate. Where your client provides the Landlord and Leaseholder certificates it is important to capture the financial commitment they will have. You can find the total sum payable on the landlord certificate within the work undertaken on relevant defects section. Any amount the client must pay will be taken over a 10-year period. Therefore, the amount due on Monday 14th February 2022, should be divided by 120 months and captured as or within the service charge to ensure affordability is met. Developer or Housing Association remediated properties will have no financial liability passed to the leaseholder and therefore will not impact affordability. Please note: if the application is for a property that requires fire safety remediation we will only proceed where we have satisfactory evidence in the format/s detailed above. In the event this cannot be provided we would be unable to support your customers mortgage application at this time. For customers who already hold their mortgage with Barclays against a property that requires remediation we can support rate switch applications, permission to let requests and conversion from BTL to residential or vice versa without evidence being required. Where any additional borrowing is required for existing customers, the rules detailed would apply.

  • Contract workers Contract workers Our policy on applicants who are contractors depends on if they are working on an employed or self-employed basis. Applicants employed in professional roles where contracts are provided on a fixed term basis, but each contract rolls to the next placement and so the overarching employment does not change (i.e. Junior Doctors, Teachers, Junior Solicitors), should be keyed as employed. These roles will all receive a salary. All contractors There can be no more than a 6-week gap between contracts Evidence of 12 months contracts (a minimum of 2 contracts must be provided if latest contract covers <12 months) is required  the only exception is where the applicant has recently moved from employee to contractor and provides services to their previous employer: In this case, we require confirmation that the client employed the applicant for at least 3 years before they became a contractor along with a copy of the service contract showing terms of remuneration, duration of contract and conditions of cancellation or termination There must be 3 months remaining on their current contract or alternatively be able to provide evidence of the next one Umbrella, Agency or Fixed Term contractors The following policy applies to contract workers who are employed on a PAYE basis (e.g. via an umbrella company or agency): Income is calculated on an employed basis using 3 months (or equivalent) pay slips, and taking an average where necessary, any holiday pay received is included within the average. Where the customer has any form of variable pay or bonus this should be calculated using employed policy. Applications for contractors in occupations such as professional sport will be assessed on a case-by-case basis to check for sustainability and plausibility. By recording these types of customer on the application as Employed - Fixed Term Contract this will ensure these checks can take place. Self-employed contractors For contract workers operating on a self-employed basis affordability calculations will depend on how their business is structured. Where ALL of the following additional requirements are met a daily rate calculation may be applied The firm is a limited company The firm does not employ anyone (other than the applicant(s) themselves) The applicant(s) collectively own 100% shares The applicants current contract equates to at least £218 per day or £50,000 per year (gross) Mortgage Loan-to-Value is  90% Daily-rate calculation To calculate gross income, you will Identify the lower of the following  Average Daily Rate of Pay (excl. VAT) from the 2 most recent contracts OR the most recent Daily Rate of Pay (excl. VAT) OR the actual income shown on the bank statements; then multiple by 5 and; then multiple by 46 to give the annual figure If the contract expresses pay as an hourly-rate, then the applicants income should be calculated on the assumption there are a maximum of 40 working hours per week, unless the contract or the applicant specifies a lower number of hours. The resulting weekly amount should then be multiplied by 46 working weeks to arrive at the gross annual income for affordability purposes. Additional commitments (where daily-rate is used) - When the daily-rate calculation is being used; credit commitments for which the limited company is liable/responsible (e.g. business loans, including bounce back loans) should be recorded within the application and considered as part of the overall affordability assessment. On the application, the monthly payment should be entered as shown on the business bank statements, the outstanding balance detailed as £1 and the remaining term as 1y 0m. The following additional documents are required if the daily-rate calculation is being applied Latest 3 full months consecutive personal bank statements confirming receipt of income Latest 3 full months consecutive business bank statements confirming receipt of income All contractors using the daily rate should be recorded on the application as Employed - Fixed Term Contract.

  • D-K D-K Dependent Relative Dependent Relative Applications for the purchase of residential properties that will be occupied by a dependant relative of the applicant are acceptable under lending standards. If the property being bought is being sold by a dependant relative who will then remain in the property after the sale takes place, the application must be declined. Any dependent relative must be disclosed on the application as a financial dependent. Any dependant relative must be occupying the property rent-free. Any persons aged 17 or over who are not party to the mortgage but are, or will be, occupying the property during the mortgage term must be declared on the application as an occupier. Deposit Deposit Where a property is being purchased, applicants are expected to provide a deposit of at least 5% of the purchase price The personal stake may vary depending on specialist schemes or circumstances where loan to value restrictions apply. The applicants must declare the source and amount of their deposit on the application form. Usually, the deposit will be from the applicants own savings, the sale of their previous property, a gift from relatives/partner or a combination of these sources. Barclays consider a relative or partner as the borrowers spouse or civil partner; a person (whether or not of the opposite sex) whose relationship with the borrower has the characteristics of the relationship between husband and wife; or the borrowers parent, brother, sister, child (including stepchild), grandparent or grandchild. It is not acceptable for applicants to resort to secondary borrowing to fund the deposit, for example, by raising a personal loan.

The discount arrangement is usually under a section 106 restriction. Discounted market sales are acceptable provided this restriction does not apply to the lender who may sell the property at open market value, this is known as a mortgagee in possession clause. The maximum nomination period we accept is 3 months. Maximum 85% LTV based on the discounted sale price. Where there is a section 106 agreement, the LTV must not exceed 80% of the open market value (not the discounted sale price). Product availability is based on the full market value.

Interest-only mortgages - Residential Interest-only mortgages - Residential The maximum loan to value allowed on an interest-only basis is 50% where the repayment strategy is the sale of the mortgaged property, or 75% where the repayment strategy is another allowable source. Where the repayment strategy is the sale of the mortgaged property, customers are required to have a minimum equity of: £300,000 for properties in Greater London £250,000 for properties in South-East & East Anglia £200,000 for properties in all other regions The table further below lists the postcodes for each region and equity requirement. The maximum term for an interest-only mortgage is 25 years and it must not extend into retirement. Additionally, affordability must be demonstrated no later than age 70. The maximum income multiple applicable to interest only mortgages is 5.00x (please see the Income multiples section of our lending criteria for full policy details). There is a minimum income criteria required to be eligible for interest-only borrowing (including part and part borrowing): Sole application  the applicant must have a gross income of at least £75,000 Joint application  one applicant must have a gross income of at least £75,000 Joint application  where no individual income is over £75,000, joint gross income must be at least £100,000 Income must meet lending standards requirements with regards allowable gross income types i.e. Basic + sustainable allowances + self-employed income. Given the importance of the minimum income criteria, and to protect your customers, please ensure that the minimum requirements are met  particularly where a customer is at the margins of income threshold. Debt consolidation is not allowed for existing or new interest-only borrowing. The only exceptions to this being where an existing customer has a drawn mortgage reserve balance and wants to consolidate this, or where a customer wishes to add an ERC to the balance of the mortgage when remortgaging to us from a competitor. The Barclays Group requires all customers who take an interest-only mortgage to have in place a repayment plan for their loan on completion of the advance. Unless using sale of property to be mortgaged, we require the repayment vehicle to have been in place for 12 months. The Barclays Group will consider one, or a combination of the following as acceptable repayment plans for interest only mortgages: An existing endowment policy An existing stocks and shares ISA An existing (minimum 12 months) share, unit, or investment trust (professionally managed) Sale of mortgaged property Where your client wishes to use any other method of repayment to repay the interest-only amount other than the acceptable repayment plans detailed above, this is not acceptable. While it will be the customers responsibility to maintain the repayment strategy throughout the term of the mortgage, as a responsible lender, it is important for us to ensure all interest-only mortgages are supported by an acceptable repayment strategy which will be sufficient to cover the interest-only mortgage on maturity. Part and Part Borrowing  customers can borrow up to 85% LTV by choosing a Part & Part repayment option. The interest only element of the loan must be up to a maximum of 75% LTV (or 50% where the repayment strategy is the sale of the mortgaged property). In addition, where the repayment strategy is the sale of the mortgaged property, at the outset there must be a minimum equity (this includes any capital and interest borrowing) after accounting for any interest only lending amount of: £300,000 for properties in Greater London £250,000 for properties in South-East & East Anglia £200,000 for properties in all other regions The table below lists the postcodes for each region and equity requirement. For example, for a £600,000 property in Greater London (based on the valuation or purchase price  whichever is lower), to meet the equity requirement the customer could borrow maximum of £300,000 on an interest only basis (50%), and £210,000 on capital and interest repayment (35%). So, the total LTV is 85%. Transactions at Undervalue  eligibility must be based on the actual purchase price and not the property valuation Existing interest only customers Existing interest only customers wishing to borrow additional funds or port must meet the current lending standards relating to interest only. This includes meeting the minimum income threshold. Existing customers who do not meet current lending standards for interest only would need to switch their repayment type to capital and interest Interest-only repayment vehicles We require a plausibility check to be done on all interest-only mortgages as per the assessment guidelines in the table below. This will determine if your client can borrow the required amount on an interest-only basis. Documentary evidence must be submitted with the mortgage application and will be checked as part of the underwriting process.

Sale of mortgaged property For residential mortgages a maximum LTV of 50% applies to the interest only part of the loan (so you know  you can borrow up to 85% LTV on a part and part basis). Where the sale of property is used as a repayment strategy, any lending beyond 50% LTV must be taken on a capital and interest repayment basis). There is also an additional requirement to have a minimum equity, after the capital and interest part of the loan in repaid, of: £300,000 for properties in Greater London £250,000 for properties in South-East & East Anglia £200,000 for properties in all other regions Internet bank statements - Residential Internet bank statements - Residential If the bank statements are from the internet (i.e. screen shots or print offs from internet banking websites/applications) then they are acceptable if either (1) they have been stamped and certified by the issuing bank or (2) the statements show the sort code, account number and the applicants full name (or this information can be seen elsewhere and cross-referenced to full bank statements).

  • Interest-only mortgages - Residential Interest-only mortgages - Residential The maximum loan to value allowed on an interest-only basis is 50% where the repayment strategy is the sale of the mortgaged property, or 75% where the repayment strategy is another allowable source. Where the repayment strategy is the sale of the mortgaged property, customers are required to have a minimum equity of: £300,000 for properties in Greater London £250,000 for properties in South-East & East Anglia £200,000 for properties in all other regions The table further below lists the postcodes for each region and equity requirement. The maximum term for an interest-only mortgage is 25 years and it must not extend into retirement. Additionally, affordability must be demonstrated no later than age 70. The maximum income multiple applicable to interest only mortgages is 5.00x (please see the Income multiples section of our lending criteria for full policy details). There is a minimum income criteria required to be eligible for interest-only borrowing (including part and part borrowing): Sole application  the applicant must have a gross income of at least £75,000 Joint application  one applicant must have a gross income of at least £75,000 Joint application  where no individual income is over £75,000, joint gross income must be at least £100,000 Income must meet lending standards requirements with regards allowable gross income types i.e. Basic + sustainable allowances + self-employed income. Given the importance of the minimum income criteria, and to protect your customers, please ensure that the minimum requirements are met  particularly where a customer is at the margins of income threshold. Debt consolidation is not allowed for existing or new interest-only borrowing. The only exceptions to this being where an existing customer has a drawn mortgage reserve balance and wants to consolidate this, or where a customer wishes to add an ERC to the balance of the mortgage when remortgaging to us from a competitor. The Barclays Group requires all customers who take an interest-only mortgage to have in place a repayment plan for their loan on completion of the advance. Unless using sale of property to be mortgaged, we require the repayment vehicle to have been in place for 12 months. The Barclays Group will consider one, or a combination of the following as acceptable repayment plans for interest only mortgages: An existing endowment policy An existing stocks and shares ISA An existing (minimum 12 months) share, unit, or investment trust (professionally managed) Sale of mortgaged property Where your client wishes to use any other method of repayment to repay the interest-only amount other than the acceptable repayment plans detailed above, this is not acceptable. While it will be the customers responsibility to maintain the repayment strategy throughout the term of the mortgage, as a responsible lender, it is important for us to ensure all interest-only mortgages are supported by an acceptable repayment strategy which will be sufficient to cover the interest-only mortgage on maturity. Part and Part Borrowing  customers can borrow up to 85% LTV by choosing a Part & Part repayment option. The interest only element of the loan must be up to a maximum of 75% LTV (or 50% where the repayment strategy is the sale of the mortgaged property). In addition, where the repayment strategy is the sale of the mortgaged property, at the outset there must be a minimum equity (this includes any capital and interest borrowing) after accounting for any interest only lending amount of: £300,000 for properties in Greater London £250,000 for properties in South-East & East Anglia £200,000 for properties in all other regions The table below lists the postcodes for each region and equity requirement. For example, for a £600,000 property in Greater London (based on the valuation or purchase price  whichever is lower), to meet the equity requirement the customer could borrow maximum of £300,000 on an interest only basis (50%), and £210,000 on capital and interest repayment (35%). So, the total LTV is 85%. Transactions at Undervalue  eligibility must be based on the actual purchase price and not the property valuation Existing interest only customers Existing interest only customers wishing to borrow additional funds or port must meet the current lending standards relating to interest only. This includes meeting the minimum income threshold. Existing customers who do not meet current lending standards for interest only would need to switch their repayment type to capital and interest Interest-only repayment vehicles We require a plausibility check to be done on all interest-only mortgages as per the assessment guidelines in the table below. This will determine if your client can borrow the required amount on an interest-only basis. Documentary evidence must be submitted with the mortgage application and will be checked as part of the underwriting process.

Latest statement  the statement must have been issued no longer than 1 year previously Current balance evidenced must be sufficient to cover the interest only mortgage amount at the point of application. Potential growth must not be included. Sale of mortgaged property For residential mortgages a maximum LTV of 50% applies to the interest only part of the loan (so you know  you can borrow up to 85% LTV on a part and part basis). Where the sale of property is used as a repayment strategy, any lending beyond 50% LTV must be taken on a capital and interest repayment basis). There is also an additional requirement to have a minimum equity, after the capital and interest part of the loan in repaid, of: £300,000 for properties in Greater London £250,000 for properties in South-East & East Anglia £200,000 for properties in all other regions

Under no circumstances can a mortgage be agreed where any party named on the title deeds is not also going to be a mortgage borrower. All other elements of Standard Lending Policy are to apply. Notes: If the non-proprietor has any existing residential mortgage commitments (ie not BTL/PLT) these must be taken into account in the affordability assessment. Calculations should be made on a standard repayment basis over the remaining mortgage term at the current pay rate or stressed rate, whichever is higher Products under the NewBuy scheme allowing the maximum LTV to be increased to 95% on new build purchases in England for specific participating builders are available under this borrowing structure for the purchase of principal residence of named occupier/s For intermediary use only. New build properties - Residential New build properties - Residential For Residential and BTL lending purposes the definition of a new build is a property that was first registered 2 or fewer years ago and the property is subject to first sale by the developer, regardless of time or any rental usage in the interim. This may be because the property is a new construction, a conversion or a renovation from an earlier use. Builders deposit and incentives Builder financial incentives are acceptable provided the incentive does not have to be repaid and the builder/developer does not intend to register a charge against the property. It is acceptable for financial incentives to be used towards funding the deposit, provided the borrower is funding at least 5% of the purchase price from their own funds (this may include a gift from a relative). Where the combined value of any financial incentives exceeds 5% of the valuation (or purchase price where lower), the amount of the incentive greater than 5% will be deducted from the valuation (or purchase price where lower) and the LTV, for the purposes of calculating the maximum loan amount, will be calculated based on the resultant value: Example (new build house): Lower of: Valuation/ purchase price £200,000 Builder cash Incentive £22,000 This equates to 11% of the valuation/ purchase price. Incentive amount in excess of 5% limit £12,000 (6%) This must then be deducted from the valuation of £200,000 £200,000 - £12,000 = £188,000 Maximum loan £169,200 (90%* of £188,000) *Refer to current criteria for the prevailing maximum LTV Upgrades forming an integral part of the property would not be considered as a part of the 5% cash incentive threshold. Examples of these would be: White goods (where not included as standard specification) Floor coverings Integrated lighting (downlighters) Kitchen upgrade, including tiling and worktop Bathroom upgrade All electric upgrade  i.e. additional sockets, TV points, etc. PV (photovoltaic) panels Turfing/landscaping In all instances where there is an incentive being offered, the applicant(s) must provide full details of the type and amount as part of the application submission and all such incentives must be declared to the valuer on the UK Finance Disclosure form in order that they can be taken into account when valuing the property. Offer validity A mortgage offer is valid for six months from the date we receive the application. New-build property sales are often agreed off plan, or in the early stages of development. As a result, completion might take longer than six months. If an offer doesnt complete within six months, we can usually extend it for another six months without the need for you to submit the status documents again. Well only be able to extend the offer period with confirmation that the customers circumstances havent changed significantly since the original application was submitted  youll need to confirm this using the New Build Mortgage Offer Extension form. Well also need to assess the application again against current lending standards, and carry out a new credit search. If theres been a significant change to the customers circumstances, well need to carry out a full underwriting assessment, including a status assessment. We might need to offer the customer a different mortgage product. The customer will need to cover all costs involved. Second properties If a customer already owns a property (and theyre not selling that property), our maximum LTV is 80%. Under specialist schemes like Help to Buy, a customer wont be able to buy a new property if they own any other properties (including residential, buy to let or held-on-permission to let). Sub-sales and sale contract reassignments Sub-sales or sale contract/lease reassignments happen if a new-build property is currently contracted for sale to a third party and hasnt yet completed. These are acceptable as long as The valuer we instruct is aware of the nature of the transaction The LTV is less than 70% of the purchase price or valuation, whichever is lower The total mortgage lending is less than the contracted sale price to the third party We have evidence that all deposit funds are either from the applicants own resources, a gift from a relative, or a combination of these Theres no family or other relationship between any applicant and the seller or third party Well decline any transaction that doesnt meet all of these criteria. More information about new builds We are happy to consider a mortgage for an applicant who has existing properties (whether mortgaged or unencumbered). Where the applicants have an existing/second residential property that has not been sold and there is reason to believe is not to be sold before completion (includes where held/to be held on a PTL basis), an application is acceptable subject to a maximum LTV of 80% applying to the property being purchased providing: The new property being purchased is for owner occupation or will be occupied by a dependent relative* of the applicant The property being bought is not that being sold by a dependent relative who will then remain in the property after the sale takes place. If this is the case, then the application must be declined Any dependent relative must be occupying the property rent free * Relative or Partner is defined as The borrowers spouse or civil partner; a person (whether or not of the opposite sex) whose relationship with the borrower has the characteristics of the relationship between husband and wife; or the borrowers parent, brother, sister, child (including stepchild), grandparent or grandchild. Additional borrowing and remortgages can be considered where any additional funds are for essential home improvements. Where any existing property is held on a Buy to Let basis, it is acceptable to consider lending up to a maximum LTV of 90%. If the mortgages held are on a Buy to Let (BTL) or Permission to Let (PTL) basis, then the contractual monthly payment will be treated as commitment when assessing affordability (rental income should be evidenced as self-employed income). For background Buy to Let Mortgages, you will need to provide one of the following A copy of the original BTL mortgage offer A letter from the lender confirming it is a BTL. If they hold any Woolwich/Barclays BTL mortgages, simply detail the account numbers for us For background PTL Mortgages you will need to provide A letter from the lender confirming this Where the original loan can NOT be confirmed on a Buy to Let or Permission to Let basis Any existing mortgage or secured loan which has not been evidenced as a Buy to Let/Permission to Let and will not be redeemed on completion of the new mortgage will be treated as follows For affordability purposes, the mortgage commitment on second properties will be calculated on a standard repayment basis over the outstanding mortgage term at the pay-rate or our stressed rate, whichever is the higher. Where a credit limit applies to the existing mortgage borrowing then it is this figure, including any undrawn monies, which should be used when assessing affordability In addition, a fixed value commitment for each additional residential property needs to be applied to cover all other property costs. This is applied automatically by the system for residential mortgaged properties documented in the application Advisers need to add actual costs for non-mortgaged properties. This applies to all other residential properties, such as second residential homes, but not any property confirmed as being on a Buy to Let or Permission to Let unless the property is empty at the time of application and the landlord is responsible for paying costs associated with the vacant property (such as council tax and service charges) Acceptable warranties include: ABC+ Advantage/ Advantage Home Construction Insurance (AHCI) (Only warranties underwritten by CGICE) ARK 10 Year Structural Defects Insurance Build Assure (New Homes Structural Defects Insurance) Build-Zone Structural Warranty (including Build-Care CADIS Checkmate Castle 10 New Home Warranty Global Home Warranties 10 Year Structural Defects Insurance Protek, Home Proof (previously AEDIS Warranties Ltd) (Only warranties underwritten by Millenium, SCOR or Titanium Insurance Company) ICW (International Construction Warranties) LABC New Home Warranty NHBC One Guarantee Premier Guarantee Q Policy/ Q Assure CRL (no longer trading): Policies backed by Casualty and General, or ARK are still acceptable.

  • New build properties - Residential New build properties - Residential For Residential and BTL lending purposes the definition of a new build is a property that was first registered 2 or fewer years ago and the property is subject to first sale by the developer, regardless of time or any rental usage in the interim. This may be because the property is a new construction, a conversion or a renovation from an earlier use. Builders deposit and incentives Builder financial incentives are acceptable provided the incentive does not have to be repaid and the builder/developer does not intend to register a charge against the property. It is acceptable for financial incentives to be used towards funding the deposit, provided the borrower is funding at least 5% of the purchase price from their own funds (this may include a gift from a relative). Where the combined value of any financial incentives exceeds 5% of the valuation (or purchase price where lower), the amount of the incentive greater than 5% will be deducted from the valuation (or purchase price where lower) and the LTV, for the purposes of calculating the maximum loan amount, will be calculated based on the resultant value: Example (new build house): Lower of: Valuation/ purchase price £200,000 Builder cash Incentive £22,000 This equates to 11% of the valuation/ purchase price. Incentive amount in excess of 5% limit £12,000 (6%) This must then be deducted from the valuation of £200,000 £200,000 - £12,000 = £188,000 Maximum loan £169,200 (90%* of £188,000) *Refer to current criteria for the prevailing maximum LTV Upgrades forming an integral part of the property would not be considered as a part of the 5% cash incentive threshold.

Offer validity A mortgage offer is valid for six months from the date we receive the application. New-build property sales are often agreed off plan, or in the early stages of development. As a result, completion might take longer than six months. If an offer doesnt complete within six months, we can usually extend it for another six months without the need for you to submit the status documents again. Well only be able to extend the offer period with confirmation that the customers circumstances havent changed significantly since the original application was submitted  youll need to confirm this using the New Build Mortgage Offer Extension form. Well also need to assess the application again against current lending standards, and carry out a new credit search. If theres been a significant change to the customers circumstances, well need to carry out a full underwriting assessment, including a status assessment. We might need to offer the customer a different mortgage product. The customer will need to cover all costs involved. Second properties If a customer already owns a property (and theyre not selling that property), our maximum LTV is 80%. Under specialist schemes like Help to Buy, a customer wont be able to buy a new property if they own any other properties (including residential, buy to let or held-on-permission to let). Sub-sales and sale contract reassignments Sub-sales or sale contract/lease reassignments happen if a new-build property is currently contracted for sale to a third party and hasnt yet completed.

Additional borrowing and remortgages can be considered where any additional funds are for essential home improvements. Where any existing property is held on a Buy to Let basis, it is acceptable to consider lending up to a maximum LTV of 90%.

  • O-Q O-Q Offer validity Offer validity A mortgage offer is valid for a 6-month period from the date the mortgage application is received by our teams. Any offer that does not complete within this period must be re-submitted as a new application with the exception of New Build Purchase applications which can be assessed against current lending standards with a refreshed credit search and re-offered for a further period of 6 months with the existing product or a product from the current range. This is subject to receiving confirmation that there has been no material change to the customer(s) circumstances since the original application was submitted using the New Build Mortgage Offer Extension Declaration form. If there has been a material change, the application will be fully re-assessed against current lending standards. An updated valuation should be requested in all scenarios with the exception of where the tolerance, referred to below, applies and for New Build Purchase applications where the original valuation will be accepted. Any subsequent extension requirement will be subject to full re-submission. The valuation validity period aligns with the offer validity period of 6 months from submission with the exception of New Build Purchase applications which are re-offered for a further period of 6 months with the valuation validity aligned to the new offer validity period. Where notice has been given that the proposed property has fallen through and a new property found, a new application must be submitted unless purchase price and mortgage amount are all unchanged and completion is anticipated within 6 months of the original submission. A product will need to be selected from the current range available unless the original product remains available. For non new build purchase and remortgage we also offer 2 week extension Applications can only be extended once and a new offer will be produced for the solicitor so they can proceed with the completion. Overage Overage Overage is an agreement in which the seller can obtain a portion of the future value of a property. This increase in value can be attributed to a future development. Where a property is sold to a buyer, and its worth more when the property is sold on, the seller may be entitled to claim back some of the difference in sales prices. For this to happen, the value needs to have increased for one of the reasons set out in the overage deed  for example, the land has planning permission. -Negative- overage can apply where the buyer covenants with the vendor on the sale of the property that, eg, no development will take place on the property that the vendor does not permit or without the vendors consent. To ensure the vendor gets the benefit of the overage payment the deed is usually secured by any or all of the following methods: a charge or restriction secured against the property, a direct deed of covenant or a guarantee. They are usually very complicated arrangements and are have sometimes been found to contain defective drafting. It is not acceptable to lend to new customers where there is an existing Overage agreement or where it is intended to create one on completion of the purchase/re-mortgage. Overpayments and Rate Switch Journey Overpayments and Rate Switch Journey Where a customer has made overpayments, it is important you look at both section 3 and 6 of the ESIS document. Section 3 will include the balance after any overpayments have been accounted for. In section 6 you will see the current outstanding balance without overpayments being considered. For this reason, the balance will be higher in section 6 if overpayments have been made. The monthly payment figure is based on the full outstanding balance (this is before any overpayment is considered). When the rate switch has completed the customer will be sent a letter which will advise of the monthly payment considering any overpayment balance. Customers can choose to apply their overpayments to the mortgage balance outstanding, but it is important to check if any early repayment charges would apply. See images below for further clarity: Section 3 of the ESIS Note: This is the section showing the balance with over payments taking into account. Section 6 of the ESIS Note: Here the mortgage balance is higher as the customer has an overpayment balance of £6846 which is not being taken into account and why the balance is different between this section and section 3. The monthly payment value is based on this higher balance but there is no need to query this with us and you can advise your customer they will receive a letter that details the monthly payment after their rate is changed which will be a lower figure as it will take into account the overpayments held. Note: Per Annum is the twelvemonth period from the end date of the product. For example, a rate which is fixed until 30 April 2014 - the scheme end date is 30/04/2014 therefore the annual period runs backwards from 30/04/2014 to 01/05/2013, 30/04/2013 to 01/05/2012 etc. Permission to let Permission to let Your clients can apply for permission to let if theyre looking to move away from a property temporarily and let it out, for example, if theyre relocating for work or are a member of the armed forces. Before they apply, theyll need to meet these conditions Their mortgage account needs to be up to date, with no arrears. Well also check whether theyve made payments on time for the last six months Theyll need to let out their property using a tenancy agreement we accept, like an assured shorthold tenancy They cant let out their property on more than one tenancy agreement If we give your client consent to let their home, there will be some new conditions for their mortgage during the tenancy agreement They cant apply to borrow more against the property, though we might consider this if they need the money to improve or repair the property They need to tell their buildings and contents insurance provider about their new mortgage agreement, as it might affect their cover Your clients will need to contact us directly to discuss switching rates or making any other changes to the mortgage while they have permission to let. Please dont submit this type of application We offer additional options if your clients want to let their property. See Short-term letting for more information. Porting - Residential Porting - Residential Porting allows mortgage customers to carry forward (port) their existing mortgage product, including the interest rate and any Early Repayment Change (ERC) conditions, to a new mortgage. Existing customers can port when they are redeeming their existing mortgage and purchasing a new property (moving home). Please note it is not possible to port a product onto a property that the customer already owns. Criteria Porting must take place either at the time the customer redeems the mortgage product they wish to port and completes on a new mortgage or within 90 days of redemption of the previous mortgage Any additional borrowing required must be taken out on a product that is available at the time of porting. Customers moving home who incur an Early Repayment Charge (ERC) on full redemption will have any ERCs refunded as long as they port their existing product, complete at the same time or within 90 days of redemption and the new mortgage is for at least 75% of their redeemed balance Ported applications that fail to complete within 90 days of redemption, will need to be updated to a non-ported case on a new product available at the time, and any ERC arising from the original product will not be refunded. Reduced Borrowing  A reduction in borrowing of up to 25% is allowed without incurring any Early Repayment Charges. Where a reduction in borrowing is above 25%, an ERC will be payable on the amount above 25%. Porting an Offset Mortgage  Customers moving home who do not require any additional borrowing are able to port in the normal way. Customers requiring additional borrowing can either select an Offset product from the current range for the total loan amount required, or they may port their loan balance to a Ported Tracker at their existing interest rate and then take any additional borrowing on a product from the current range. Mortgage Current Account Reserves  Some customers may have a Mortgage Current Account Reserve. These are not portable and if there are any drawn funds at the time of redemption they must be repaid. A new Reserve will not be offered on the customers new mortgage.

PAT (Profit after tax) Profit, after any applicable corporation tax has been deducted, can be considered towards the affordability assessment, in addition to the applicants directors salary where applicable, where the following requirements are met: The Loan amount (less capitalised product fees) is Over or equal to £1m. (Where the loan amount is below £1m the affordability assessment will be based on the applicants directors salary and dividends only. PAT cannot be taken into consideration. The borrower(s) collectively own greater than 50% of the companys shares. The maximum amount of Limited Company PAT that can be considered as part of the overall affordability assessment is the lower of: 50% of the three-year average Limited Company PAT, or 50% of the Limited Company PAT for the latest trading year. The amount of PAT used will be determined by the percentage shareholding of the applicant. E.g. where the borrower is a 70% shareholder a maximum 35% of PAT can be considered (50% of 70%) The Maximum amount of PAT used towards affordability cannot exceed 5x the average {Salary + Dividends} paid to the applicant(s) over 2 most recent years, as evidenced by the 2 latest tax calculations. Where more than 25% of the companys trading income is received in a currency other than GBP the maximum amount of PAT that can be used towards affordability reduces to 40% (further reduced where the applicants combined shareholding is less than 100%, as described above). Applicants that have received a loan from the company that remains outstanding at the point of application would require the amount they are repaying each month to be captured as a commitment within the affordability assessment as 1/12 of the outstanding amount (as evidenced by an accountants letter) Detail needed for accountants letter can be found in Useful documents under Limited Company Profit After Tax For more information please refer to the Limited Company Profit After Tax form.

This would then allow the government to have first refusal on purchasing the property back at full market price New Supply Shared Equity Scheme Available to first-time buyers to assist with the purchase of new build properties As with the above open market scheme, standard shared equity requirements apply in addition to acceptance of Golden Share where this applies Help-to-buy Scotland Please refer to the help-to-buy section Shared ownership Shared ownership Under shared ownership schemes, the customer part-owns and part-rents the property from the Scheme Provider under the terms of a shared ownership lease.

Re-mortgages from another lender are acceptable provided agreement from the scheme provider is obtained and all areas of this section of lending guidelines are met i.e. the new mortgage should be for the same amount, unless staircasing or additional borrowing is required to buy-out a co-owner. Notes: Products under the NewBuy and Help to Buy schemes are not available for any Shared Ownership proposition. If the scheme does not meet all the above criteria then Barclays will not lend.

Short-term letting Short-term letting People who have residential mortgages with us can let out their property, or part of their property (for example, a room or an annexe), using short-term letting platforms weve approved. They dont have to get permission from us, as long as They use an online short-term occupancy platform thats on our approved list (see below) They agree the occupation under license and not using a tenancy agreement The property isnt occupied by someone other than the owner for longer than 90 days in any 12-calendar month period, and for no longer than 30 days consecutively by anyone other than the owner Their buildings insurance is always valid They arent breaching any requirements or regulations of local and other relevant authorities For special schemes (for example, Help to Buy or shared ownership) they might need to get permission from the scheme provider before letting out any of their property. They might also need consent from any second charge lenders Online short-term occupancy platforms we accept Airbnb You should let your client know that well still send correspondence to the property if they chose it as their correspondence address, even if its being rented out. Rental income from renting out this property or part of it (for example, using a short-term letting arrangement) cant be considered for affordability. It should be deducted from the overall amount of rental income an applicant provides evidence of. We offer additional options if your clients want to let their property. See Permission to let for more information. S.106 agreement (S.75 in Scotland) S.106 agreement (S.75 in Scotland) The valuer must be able to value the property on a residential basis ignoring any possible business usage. Right to buy pre-emption clauses giving the council first rights for an onward sale within the first 10 years are acceptable. If the valuation is satisfactory then the property will constitute suitable security if ALL of the following requirements are also met: The maximum LTV is the lower of 80% of the open market value or 85% of the purchase price. S.106 agreements must contain a mortgage exclusion clause to protect the mortgage in the event that the registered provider defaults. Restrictions on re-sale/disposal The S.106 agreement may stipulate that the Local authority has the right to nominate a buyer (meeting defined eligibility requirements) when the property is sold or disposed of. Discount market sales will typically have a S.106 present to ensure the discount remains for future sales, these are acceptable provided there is a mortgage in possession clause. Where the restriction includes a nomination period, these are acceptable provided the nomination period is no more than 3 months. Term of mortgage - Residential Term of mortgage - Residential For new interest-only mortgage customers, the term cant extend into retirement. Our usual mortgage term is between 5 and 40 years (25 for interest only, including part and part). Certain products also have specific requirements around their maximum mortgage term  for example, Family Springboard. See Lending products for more details about specific products. Transaction under value Transaction under value Transactions at undervalue can occur where a property is being or has been acquired by way of a Deed of Gift, or for less than the full market value. For such a transaction to be acceptable to Barclays the vendor must be a relative of the applicant or the applicants landlord. Where an Advisor is aware that a mortgage request is to be a transaction at undervalue, Mortgage Services must be notified at initial application stage to ensure the scenario is acceptable based on the above relationship requirements. In such cases problems may arise under the Insolvency Act 1986. Under Section 339 of the Insolvency Act 1986, a trustee in bankruptcy has the right to apply to the Courts to set aside a transaction at an undervalue, if the transferor subsequently becomes bankrupt within 5 years of the date of the transfer. The period during which the transfer can be set aside is reduced to 2 years if a Declaration of Solvency is obtained at the time of the transfer and the transferor does not become insolvent as a result of the transaction. Where it is confirmed that the applicant is purchasing their property at an undervalue as defined above, a minimum deposit of 5%, based on the lower of valuation or discounted purchase price, must be provided from the applicants own resources. It must be confirmed that the property being bought is not that being sold by a dependant relative who will then remain in the property after the sale takes place. If this is the case, then the application must be declined. The above deposit requirement does not apply to Springboard Mortgage transactions where a minimum 5% deposit is required based on lower of valuation and discounted purchase price with a further 10% cash deposit to be held in line with standard requirements applicable to a Springboard Mortgage Product. Valuation appeals Valuation appeals Customers can appeal against Valuations where the following apply For remortgages and further advance cases, where there is more than a 25% variance between the customers estimated value and the actual valuation provided by the Banks nominated valuer. For purchase cases, where there is a variance of more than 10% between the purchase price and the valuation.Appeals can only be considered when submitted against a physical valuation (i.e. not an AVM). This applies to both Residential and Buy to Let cases. Appeals can only be considered when submitted against a physical valuation (i.e. not an AVM). If your customer wishes to appeal the valuation in line with the guidance above, you will need to contact your Barclays Support Team or email mailto:brokersupport@barclays.com. An appeals form will be issued and you will be required to supply 3 comparable properties sold in the last 6 months. Valuations - Residential Valuations - Residential To be able to lend on a property, Barclays requires a valuation to be carried out. When you apply for a Barclays mortgage, the valuation type depends on whether your mortgage will be on a residential or Buy to Let basis. The mortgage valuation is our standard report for all residential applications and includes a description of the property, an opinion of the market value of the property as at the date of inspection, and an estimate of the current cost to reinstate the property in its present form (where appropriate). Its important to remember that the mortgage valuation is a report which is primarily for Barclays purposes and confirms whether the property is suitable security for a mortgage  it is not a survey. As such, we ask that all clients consider instructing a separate survey to provide them with a more detailed assessment of the condition of the property, especially when an AVM has been accepted for lending purposes. Your client may wish to contact Countrywide Surveying Services on 0800 012 6995, e.surv Chartered Surveyors on 0800 169 9661, or any other provider to discuss the different survey options available. More information on the types of survey available can be seen found on the Home Surveys section of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors website. Please note that if your clients do instruct their own survey, this will be a separate contract between them and their chosen survey provider with separate fees applying. Barclays will always rely on the mortgage valuation for the purpose of agreeing the mortgage. Automated valuation model (AVM) For remortgages on properties up to £1m in value (up to £2m in London and South East), where the loan to value required is 80% (subject to product availability) or less. For purchases on properties up to £1m in value (up to £2m in London and South East), AVMs can be used on any LTV (subject to product availability). We use AVMs to assist with instant mortgage decisions. Whether you apply through MAX or via other online systems*, the use of AVMs will help speed up the decision and offer a better process for your customer. Where an AVM is not provided an alternative valuation will be undertaken. AVMs are only suitable for further borrowing where the latest valuation was a physical one and not an AVM. In all further borrowing cases where the latest valuation was an AVM, a Non-Disclosed PRA valuation must be requested. * For example, via MTE or Trigold.

PAT (Profit after tax) Profit, after any applicable corporation tax has been deducted, can be considered towards the affordability assessment, in addition to the applicants directors salary where applicable, where the following requirements are met: The Loan amount (less capitalised product fees) is Over or equal to £1m. (Where the loan amount is below £1m the affordability assessment will be based on the applicants directors salary and dividends only. PAT cannot be taken into consideration. The borrower(s) collectively own greater than 50% of the companys shares. The maximum amount of Limited Company PAT that can be considered as part of the overall affordability assessment is the lower of: 50% of the three-year average Limited Company PAT, or 50% of the Limited Company PAT for the latest trading year. The amount of PAT used will be determined by the percentage shareholding of the applicant.

Right to buy pre-emption clauses giving the council first rights for an onward sale within the first 10 years are acceptable. If the valuation is satisfactory then the property will constitute suitable security if ALL of the following requirements are also met: The maximum LTV is the lower of 80% of the open market value or 85% of the purchase price. S.106 agreements must contain a mortgage exclusion clause to protect the mortgage in the event that the registered provider defaults. Restrictions on re-sale/disposal The S.106 agreement may stipulate that the Local authority has the right to nominate a buyer (meeting defined eligibility requirements) when the property is sold or disposed of.

  • Transaction under value Transaction under value Transactions at undervalue can occur where a property is being or has been acquired by way of a Deed of Gift, or for less than the full market value. For such a transaction to be acceptable to Barclays the vendor must be a relative of the applicant or the applicants landlord. Where an Advisor is aware that a mortgage request is to be a transaction at undervalue, Mortgage Services must be notified at initial application stage to ensure the scenario is acceptable based on the above relationship requirements. In such cases problems may arise under the Insolvency Act 1986. Under Section 339 of the Insolvency Act 1986, a trustee in bankruptcy has the right to apply to the Courts to set aside a transaction at an undervalue, if the transferor subsequently becomes bankrupt within 5 years of the date of the transfer. The period during which the transfer can be set aside is reduced to 2 years if a Declaration of Solvency is obtained at the time of the transfer and the transferor does not become insolvent as a result of the transaction. Where it is confirmed that the applicant is purchasing their property at an undervalue as defined above, a minimum deposit of 5%, based on the lower of valuation or discounted purchase price, must be provided from the applicants own resources. It must be confirmed that the property being bought is not that being sold by a dependant relative who will then remain in the property after the sale takes place. If this is the case, then the application must be declined. The above deposit requirement does not apply to Springboard Mortgage transactions where a minimum 5% deposit is required based on lower of valuation and discounted purchase price with a further 10% cash deposit to be held in line with standard requirements applicable to a Springboard Mortgage Product.

  • Valuations - Residential Valuations - Residential To be able to lend on a property, Barclays requires a valuation to be carried out. When you apply for a Barclays mortgage, the valuation type depends on whether your mortgage will be on a residential or Buy to Let basis. The mortgage valuation is our standard report for all residential applications and includes a description of the property, an opinion of the market value of the property as at the date of inspection, and an estimate of the current cost to reinstate the property in its present form (where appropriate). Its important to remember that the mortgage valuation is a report which is primarily for Barclays purposes and confirms whether the property is suitable security for a mortgage  it is not a survey. As such, we ask that all clients consider instructing a separate survey to provide them with a more detailed assessment of the condition of the property, especially when an AVM has been accepted for lending purposes. Your client may wish to contact Countrywide Surveying Services on 0800 012 6995, e.surv Chartered Surveyors on 0800 169 9661, or any other provider to discuss the different survey options available. More information on the types of survey available can be seen found on the Home Surveys section of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors website. Please note that if your clients do instruct their own survey, this will be a separate contract between them and their chosen survey provider with separate fees applying. Barclays will always rely on the mortgage valuation for the purpose of agreeing the mortgage. Automated valuation model (AVM) For remortgages on properties up to £1m in value (up to £2m in London and South East), where the loan to value required is 80% (subject to product availability) or less. For purchases on properties up to £1m in value (up to £2m in London and South East), AVMs can be used on any LTV (subject to product availability). We use AVMs to assist with instant mortgage decisions. Whether you apply through MAX or via other online systems*, the use of AVMs will help speed up the decision and offer a better process for your customer. Where an AVM is not provided an alternative valuation will be undertaken. AVMs are only suitable for further borrowing where the latest valuation was a physical one and not an AVM. In all further borrowing cases where the latest valuation was an AVM, a Non-Disclosed PRA valuation must be requested. * For example, via MTE or Trigold.
