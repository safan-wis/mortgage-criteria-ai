### Acreage/Agricultural restriction

We don’t have a maximum plot size.Where a property is over 4 hectares/10 acres, we will be able to consider the property subject to underwriter assessment and a suitable valuation report.Agricultural restrictions limit the occupancy of a property to persons employed in an agriculture related job. Residential applications for the purchase or remortgage of a customer’s main residence where an agricultural restriction is in place may be considered subject to:• The applicant must be employed in an agricultural related job; however their primary source of income must not be related to the mortgaged property.• Maximum Loan to Value (LTV) is 50%.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### Additional Borrowing Purposes

We can consider additional borrowing for a wide range of purposes. Common examples of additional borrowing include:Debt ConsolidationHome ImprovementsPurchase of another propertyWe will need to know the intended property being purchased and any future mortgage commitments. The underwriter may request:A copy of the sale particulars or memorandum of sale.A KFI or mortgage offer, where this will be mortgaged.An ARLA letter where a rental property is being purchased.Buy to Let / Consent to LetWhere a customer requests additional borrowing on a Buy to Let or Consent to Let property, the following circumstances can’t be considered:GamblingAny form of business purpose (i.e. start up for a new business but please note this does not include buying a buy to let in a limited company name)Unsecured Debt Consolidation.For more information on Additional Borrowing, please visit our dedicated hub here:Additional Borrowing Hub.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### Additional Income

Where the customer is in receipt of regular additional income as part of their employment, you should understand the nature of this income to ensure it is considered a variation of acceptable income types (seeIncome and Packaging Hub),not an expenses related payment and that current levels will continue long term.Further information on Additional Incomes/Occupations can be seen in the A-Z that include:· Long Term Town Allowance· NHS Bank· Pilot/Cabin crew· Shift Allowances· Seafarers· Tips/Tronc

### Adverse Credit

Insolvency includes:Bankruptcy or SequestrationIndividual Involuntary Arrangement (IVA) or Protected Trust DeedsDebt Relief Orders or Minimal Asset ProcessAlternative adverse history may be considered subject tocredit scoring, bank account conduct and underwriting.Additionally, within the application we ask:In the last 6 years has your client(s) had a debt repayment plan with creditors, been declared bankrupt or had a county court judgement against them?If the answer is ‘yes’ to this question, we are unable to accept the application.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### Affordability Calculators

Our affordability calculators can give a good indication of the amount we would be willing to lend.Our affordability calculators don’t conduct a credit search and as such the indicative lend for residential applications is potentially subject to change when the agreement in principle is submitted. See ‘Loan to Income’ for more information.Our calculators, applicable to both residential and additional residential borrowing, require details of your client’s overdraft balances, mail orders and budget accounts. These figures do not need to be included in the decision in principle or full mortgage application as they will be automatically verified through credit bureau data.We will use the most recent credit bureau data to determine the lending amount provided at the time of the decision in principle or full mortgage application, which will be the final amount and can’t be appealed.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### Age Requirements

Applicants must be at least 18 years old at the time of application. Maximum age will be based on the oldest applicant.ResidentialFor Capital and Interest loans the maximum age at the end of the term is 75 (or intended retirement age, whichever is sooner).For Interest Only or Mixed (part and part) loans the maximum age at the end of the term is 70 (or intended retirement age, whichever is sooner).Please seeLending into retirement- residential.Buy to LetFor Small Landlords and Portfolio Landlords the maximum age at the end of the term is 80.For customers who are non-owner occupiers/First time buyers, the maximum age is retirement age or 80 (whichever is lower).Please seeLending into retirement- Buy to Let.Please seeTermfor more information on this.

### Annual percentage rate of charge (APRC)

The APRC is all fees associated with the mortgage, whether added to the advance or not. This includes application fees, product fees, arrangement fees, booking fees, CHAPS and Telegraphic Transfer fees, fees charged by intermediaries, mortgage exit administration fees (sealing fees) and valuation fees. It is included on the Mortgage Illustration.There is an additional cost illustration, known as the second APRC. The second APRC presents a stressed interest rate scenario and illustrates what the product APRC would be if bank base interest rates rise to their 20-year high. Mortgages with a fixed rate for the entire term of the deal will not require this illustration.We calculate the new APRC and second APRC in accordance with the guidance received from the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) and include both in the Mortgage Illustration.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### Armed Forces personnel

Unsecured personal loans are only acceptable for Armed Forces personnel who are eligible for a Forces Help to Buy (FHTB) loan which is an interest-free loan repayable over 10 years:This will be allowed to be used towards an applicant's deposit but the monthly repayment as detailed on the Ministry of Defence ‘Personal Information Note’ must be included in outgoings for affordability.The FHTB loan may not be used for the purchase of a second property, including a buy-to-let property.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### Background Buy to Lets

Where the customer has any background properties that they let out, you need to tell us about this on the application. Please key the full property details including any unencumbered properties in the 'Other existing mortgages/properties' section of the application.To use surplus rental income for affordability, please seeRental Income. This is only acceptable on residential applications.If the property is self-financing (rental income covers the mortgage payment) but you don’t want to use any rental income to support affordability, this is acceptable. In this situation we will exclude the mortgage commitment from affordability.Should the property run at a loss e.g. the rental income received is less than the mortgage payment creating a shortfall, please key the shortfall amount on the application under Expenditure > Other financial commitments.Our underwriter reserves the right to ask for supporting documentation to validate what has been keyed on the application.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### Back to Back / Day 1 Remortgage

Back to back is typically where the vendor has owned the property for less than six months, or remortgages where they've owned the property for less than six months.Solicitors are required to disclose any transaction in the last six months and, if this happens, cases will be declined after offer unless the circumstances meet one of the following situations in which lending may be considered:Customer funded purchase:the customer has funded the original purchase using their own funds or funds from a close family member and are now looking to set up a mortgage to replenish their own personal savings or to repay the close family member. The lending would be restricted to the lower of the original purchase price or valuation. Proof of original savings or monies being lent by the family member may be required.Bridging:residential mortgage applications where the customers required a bridging loan due to delays in selling the existing property, subject to normal underwriting. The previous property has now been sold and the applicants are looking for a mortgage on the new property with funds to be used to repay the bridging loan. Buy to let applications are not acceptable in this situation.Inherited:a recently inherited property where the beneficiary wishes to release some of the equity for residential or buy to let purposes, or to buy the shares in the property inherited by others (e.g. siblings or joint beneficiaries). We will also consider lending where our customer wishes to purchase the property from a vendor who recently inherited the property.Porting:where a fixed or discounted rate was ported to a new property but is now expiring/has expired and the customer wants to remortgage within the 6 month period to gain a new rate. Proof of the rate roll off has to be obtained for example mortgage offer or rate roll off letter from the previous lender.Repossessed property:where the vendor is the mortgage lender in possession i.e. the property has been repossessed within the last six months and is being sold by the mortgage lender or their agent. This does not include repossessed properties being purchased cheaply at auction and then sold on by a third party.Part exchange:where the vendor is a large national house builder selling a property acquired under a part-exchange scheme.

Should they feel this is the case, where confirmation of remediation is not available through Government Remediation data or an EWS1/FRAEW is not already available for a building, the valuer may request an EWS1 form or FRAEW (Fire Risk Assessment of External Walls).All valuations remain subject to valuer’s comments.

If agreed, we will issue a letter of consent to the letting of the property and will charge an initial administration fee and an annual fee, which will start on the anniversary of the Consent To Let being agreed.Customers must have had their mortgage with us for a period of no less than 6 months (unless they are in the Armed Forces, working abroad for the Foreign or Commonwealth office or living in Tied Accommodation e.g. boarding school teacher, vicar/minster or estate worker) - this is relevant for both existing and new customers.Customers must not have a Consent To Let on any other properties mortgaged with us.·The fee is £120 initial payment and £120 per annum payable on the anniversary of our agreement to Consent to Let.

### Consumer Buy to Let

Consumer Buy to Let is a type of regulated business introduced by the MCD to provide enhanced protections where Buy to Let customers are not acting for business purposes.Our approach to identifying a consumer Buy-to-Let is based on how the customer views their Buy to Let activity. Where the customer intends to benefit from house price growth and rental income we will class this as investment purposes and can consider a BTL mortgage, as we will not treat it as a consumer BTL.Wedon’toffer consumer BTL mortgages.Sourcing Tip – If property will be used as an investment property, ensure that sourcing isn’t filtered by Consumer Buy to Let so that NatWest appears on your sourcing.For more information, please see ourBuy to Let hub.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### Dependants

A dependant is any person who relies on the customer financially for things like money, clothes or food, whether living at the property or not. This includes financially dependent partners not named on the mortgage, children under 18, those in higher education, and financially dependent elderly relatives.Where the customer pays maintenance for a child, they should not be listed as a dependant.If your customer is expecting a child, e.g. currently pregnant or has approval to adopt, then this extra dependant must be included when assessing affordability.

### Diplomatic immunity

We cannot lend to anybody working in the UK who has or may have diplomatic immunity under the Geneva Convention or inter-government treaties. This applies at all LTV levels, and is because the application would be immune from UK laws and we wouldn't be able to enforce repossession.

### Early repayment charges

An Early Repayment Charge will be incurred on any overpayment that exceeds the annual 20% limit. Please refer to the early repayment section of your Mortgage Illustration or offer document for information on early repayment charges that would be incurred if any overpayment exceeds the annual 20% limit.The year runs from the date the mortgage was taken out (or your customer's current product) and the 20% includes all sub accounts and is specific to each of these that makes up the mortgage.If customers reduce their ported balance then a partial ERC must be paid for the amount that the borrowing is being reduced by, less any overpayment allowance, if it is tied into a product at the time of redemption.For further guidance on Porting clickhere.To see the ERC’s on current products, please review ourProduct Guide.

### Mortgage Credit Directive

The European Mortgage Credit Directive (MCD) came into force on 21st March 2016. It aims to harmonise mortgage markets across the European Economic Area, ensuring that mortgage firms act fairly and professionally and that their staff have an appropriate level of knowledge and competence for advising, manufacturing and servicing mortgages. The key issues that lenders and brokers had to incorporate into their businesses were:The Key Facts Illustration (KFI) was replaced by the new European Standard Information Sheet (ESIS), which incorporates a new Annual Percentage Rate of Charge (APRC) and second APRC.A new approach to monitoring customers’ foreign exchange exposure, including where part or all of their income is in a currency other than sterling.A new classification of consumer buy-to-let mortgages.A new 7-day reflection period.Greater transparency over declined applications.Regulation of second charge lending.European Standard Information Sheet (ESIS): the MCD replaced the old sale and offer Key Facts Illustration (KFI) documentation with a new European Standard Information Sheet (ESIS) template, called a Mortgage Illustration in the UK. This document includes some additional disclosures for customers to ensure they fully understand their mortgage product and the risks of future interest rate increases. Transitional arrangements are in place to enable lenders to use a KFI 'top-up' approach before moving to the new Mortgage Illustration no later than March 2019. We have implemented the use of the new Mortgage Illustration without the transitional step of using the KFI 'top-up'.7-day reflection period: the MCD introduced a new 7-day reflection period to ensure borrowers have sufficient time to duly consider the various offers they receive. Therefore, when a mortgage offer is made to a customer, there is a 7-day reflection period where the customer’s offer will remain valid for them to accept. At any point during this period the customer can accept the offer, and likewise reject it, or allow the offer to lapse.We already give our customers longer than 7 days for them to consider offers they receive, so this will not have any impact on our current processes. If a customer wishes to complete the mortgage at any point during the 7-day reflection period they can waive the period by accepting the offer. We will still retain our right to review our decision to lend should new information be provided that changes a customer's eligibility.Mortgage application declines: the MCD required greater transparency when a mortgage application is declined by a lender. If a customer has their application declined, they need to be told of this decision in a timely manner. Furthermore, if the decline is as a result of information held about the customer by a credit reference agency, the applicant must be informed of the particular agency used.We utilise multiple credit reference agencies. Where a customer’s application is being arranged by an intermediary and is declined, it is the responsibility of the intermediary to inform the customer of the credit reference agency used if this is the reason for the decline.Regulation of second charge mortgages: the MCD required that second charge lending becomes subject to FCA mortgage rules. Lenders’ and intermediaries’ existing mortgage permissions enable them to operate in the second charge lending sector and the FCA contacted them in the first quarter of 2016 to find out if they intend to do so. We do not currently operate in the second charge lending sector and have no intentions to do so.

### Mortgage Payment (Interest)

We will charge interest monthly in arrears from the day on which we release the Loan to you or the conveyancer.Interest on your mortgage is calculated daily on the outstanding balance and applied to your account monthly on the anniversary of completion. This is called the charging period.If there isn’t 14 days between the date you complete your mortgage and your chosen payment date, we won’t take your first payment until the following month.For example, if you complete your mortgage on 15th January and your chosen payment date is 20th, your first monthly payment will be claimed on 20th February.The first months interest will be added to your account on 15th February to cover the period 15th January to 14th February.If your chosen payment date differs to the anniversary of completion date, there will be an interest balance that remains outstanding for the first month. This will remain on your mortgage balance until it’s paid, meaning you will pay more over the term of your mortgage.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### Mortgage Prisoners

Mortgage Prisoners are a group of customers identified by the FCA, who, following a Mortgage Market Review, have been unable to switch to a better mortgage deal with their existing lender or to a new lender.We are unable to accept applications from brokers who are not registered and approved by the FCA for Mortgage Prisoner cases. We can’t consider Buy to Let applications under Mortgage Prisoner policy.We contacted all the Mortgage Prisoner FCA approved firms at the point that the FCA launched the Mortgage Prisoner initiative, with guidance on how to submit this type of application to us. Should your firm not have received this guidance or have only recently been approved to provide these mortgages, first please check that your firm is named in the FCA approved listhere(at the bottom of the page under “Speak to a mortgage broker”). Once your firm’s name appears on the FCA approved list, contact our BDA team who will be able to provide you with the guidance.Mortgage Prisoner customers should be referred to their current mortgage provider for more details on their options.Please see ourMortgage Prisoners Hub.

However, a lender may also decide to change its SVR while the base rate remains unchanged.Please refer to ourproduct rangefor our current SVR.

### Student Loans

The customer’s income will determine whether they need to make Student Loan repayments. They need be included as a financial commitment where the applicant is already making repayments.When declaring the student loan commitment on the application, you need to consider:Income increases- If the customers income has recently increased and will continue at the higher level e.g. due to a pay rise, the higher student loan deduction needs to be used.Fluctuating income- If the customers income fluctuates meaning their student loan repayment changes, please average the payments over the last 3 months payslips.Example:If the student loan deduction is £50 in June, £80 in July and £80 in August, add all three amounts and divide by three.£50 + £80 + £80 = £210 / 3 = £70However, if the customer's income has increased and £80 will be the ongoing payment, this should be used instead.
