# Residential Lending Criteria — **Home M–R**

## 1) Maximum Age

**New lending limits**

* **Residential Repayment:** max **75** at end of term
* **Residential Interest-Only (IO):** max **70** at end of term
* **Joint cases:** cap is based on the **oldest applicant**

**Lending past retirement age (IO)**

* **Not permitted**: For Residential **IO**, the max age is the **earlier of** the customer’s **stated retirement age** or **70**.

> See also: **Lending into retirement** and **Term** guidance.

---

## 2) Maximum LTV

### 2.1 By repayment type & loan size

**Capital & Interest (C\&I)**

* **£80k–£600k:** **95%**
* **£600,001–£1m:** **90%**
* **£1m–£1.5m:** **85%**
* **£1.5m–£2.5m:** **80%**
* **£2.5m–£5m:** **75%**
* **£5m–£10m:** **60%**

**Interest-Only (IO)**

* **Up to £5m:** **75%**
* **£5m–£10m:** **60%**

### 2.2 Scenario caps (apply the lower cap)

* **Additional borrowing:** **90%**
* **New-build house:** **90%**
* **New-build flat/maisonette:** **80%**
* **Flat/maisonette (non–new build, subject to criteria):** **95%**
* **Debt consolidation:** **80%**

### 2.3 Must-know caveats

* **Pure IO:** max **75% LTV** (except **£5m–£10m = 60%**).
* **Part & part (≤ £2.5m total loan):** overall **max 80%**, with the **IO slice ≤ 75%** (remainder must be C\&I).
* **Flats/maisonettes > 85% LTV:** building must be **≤ 4 storeys**, **not** ex-LA/ex-MoD, and **not** new-build.
* **Product fee** may be added, but **total borrowing ≤ 95%** of the property value.

### 2.4 Quick decision flow

1. Set the **base cap** from **repayment type + loan size**.
2. Apply any **scenario cap** → use the **lower** cap.
3. **Part & part?** Ensure **total ≤ 80%**, **IO slice ≤ 75%** (if ≤ £2.5m).
4. **Flat > 85%?** Confirm **≤ 4 storeys**, **not ex-LA/MoD**, **not new-build**.
5. **Adding a fee?** Keep **total borrowing ≤ 95%**.

---

## 3) Minimum & Maximum Loan Size

* **Minimum total loan (sum of parts):** **£80,000**
* **Maximum:** per **Maximum LTV** rules and **product** specifics

---

## 4) Minimum Term

---

## 5) Mortgage-Free (Unencumbered) Property

* Customer’s solicitor must be on the **Approved Legal Panel**

---

## 6) Neighbouring Land

A mortgage is also required over **neighbouring land** if either applies:

* Access to the security is **over neighbouring land**, and/or
* Services for the security **run over neighbouring land**

*Does not apply where the applicant simply owns multiple flats in the same building.*

---

## 7) New Build — Rules & Limits

### 7.1 What counts as “new build”

Any **one** of:

* **Never occupied**

  * For **conversions**: not occupied **since conversion**
* **Being sold/marketed by the builder/developer**, even if previously tenanted
* **Constructed within 2 years** (counted to **application date**)
* **Converted into a flat within 2 years** as part of a scheme (e.g., former **mill/factory/school/church/council block**)

### 7.2 Residential LTV caps

* **House:** **up to 90%**
* **Flat/maisonette:** **up to 80%**

> Always apply the **lowest** cap after considering general LTV and scenario rules (e.g., part & part, flat height rules).

### 7.3 Incentives

**Cash incentives** (accepted **up to 5%** of purchase price; overall LTV must still fit the cap):

* Cashback, **SDLT** paid, professional fees paid, **guaranteed rent** etc.

**Non-cash incentives** (accepted without impacting loan):

* **Fixed/fitted items**, incl. **white goods**

---

## 8) Newly Qualified Professional Product

---

## 9) Offset Mortgages — Linked Accounts

**Eligible**: Certain **Virgin Money** accounts with sort code starting **82** (Clydesdale Bank).
Two groups:

* **Currently available**: **Club M Account**, **Club M Saver**, **M Plus Account**, **M Plus Saver**
* **Legacy (still linkable if already held)**: **Private Current**, **Private Savings**, **Current Account Control**, **Current Account Tracker**, **Savings Account Plus**, **Savings Account Plus – Offset**, **Offset Business Current Account**

**Key rules**

* Link up to **6** eligible accounts (any mix of current/savings)
* If **only one** account linked, it **must** be a **Virgin Money current account**
* Accounts **are not opened automatically** during the mortgage process

**Opening accounts (new apps)**

* At offer stage we’ll try to help open an account: **2 call attempts + 2 follow-up emails** and progress updates

**How offset works**

* Interest is charged on **mortgage balance minus linked savings**

  * *Example*: £500k mortgage – £100k savings → interest charged on **£400k**
* Linked savings **don’t earn interest**, but remain **accessible**
* Payments stay **the same**, so more goes to **capital**, potentially reducing **term** (for C\&I)

**Special cases**

* **Yorkshire Bank** accounts: **not linkable**
* **Interest-Only offset:** offset reduces **interest**, but **full payments** still due
* **Fully offset:** no interest charged; repayments reduce capital; may receive **credit interest** on overall offset balance
