  - [Portability criteria] Lending criteria
  - [Portability > Loan size and LTV limits for portability] The overall amount of the mortgage (existing balance and top-up) must be more than the minimum loan amount for the top-up product.
  - [Portability > Loan size and LTV limits for portability] If you choose a product with incentives then the amount of the top-up must be £50,000 or more. If the amount of the top-up element is less than £50,000 you'll have to choose either a product with no incentives or one of our portability only top-up products.
  - [Portability > Loan size and LTV limits for portability] Early repayment charges (ERC) and refunds
  - [Portability > Loan size and LTV limits for portability] Any ERCs must be paid by the customer and these will be refunded if the customer returns to Accord within 6 months of the date of redemption.
  - [Portability > Loan size and LTV limits for portability] Where a mortgage has more than one part, each individual part is subject to its own ERC. Where a product has expired between redemption and completion of the new loan, the customer must choose a product from the current range and the ERC will still be refunded (subject to completion being within 6 months of the original redemption).
  - [Portability > Loan size and LTV limits for portability] If your client is looking to borrow less than their current balance, we’ll charge ERCs on the amount they don’t port to the new mortgage.
  - [Portability > Portability valuations] In all cases a new valuation will be carried out for all portability applications, regardless of whether a top-up product is required to determine the new loan to value (LTV) of the lending.
