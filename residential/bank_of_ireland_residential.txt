4. ADVERSE CREDIT
--------------
**We’re a clean credit lender.** We won’t lend to any applicant who has eve**
  • been bankrupt
  • been subject to an Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA)
  • owned a previous property which has been taken into possession or who has surrendered voluntary possession to the lender.
We will not lend if, in the last 3 years, an applicant has had:
  • a County Court Judgement (CCJ) registered or settled within this time, or has an outstanding CCJ registered outside the 3 years
  • any arrears at all on a mortgage, fixed payment loan and/or rent
  • more than two consecutive missed payments on credit and/or store cards.
We will not usually lend if the applicant has defaulted or settled a past defaulted account on any credit agreement in the last 3 years, or has an outstanding default.
Communications and mail order records can be ignored, unless the scale and/or frequency of missed payments indicate cause for concern.


5. AFFORDABILITY
-------------
As part of our underwriting process we must assess the applicant’s income, credit commitments and cost of living expenses to ensure their ability to pay.
We need confirmation of the applicant’s committed expenditure including credit cards, overdraft, loans, hire purchase, maintenance, school fees and child care. General household expenditure, for example food and utilities, are automatically accounted for in our affordability calculator.
Any mortgage (other than a formal Buy to Let mortgage) must be included in our affordability calculator.
**To do this, you’ll need to:**
1. calculate the cost of interest on the non redeemed balance at a nominal rate of 7.30%
2. enter the monthly equivalent cost in the monthly outgoings field of our [affordability calculator](/calculators/affordability-calculator/ "Affordability Calculator").
Applicants obtaining ‘consent to let’ or a ‘let to buy’ loan must include this mortgage in the affordability assessment unless they can provide evidence of a mortgage offer which proves that the retained property is being remortgaged into a formal Buy to Let.
You can [use our affordability calculator](/calculators/affordability-calculator/ "Affordability Calculator") to estimate what your client may be able to borrow based on their income and financial commitments.

However, in determining whether a repayment strategy is credible, underwriters may consider other assets which the applicant may intend to sell, and may use these to justify an exception should the projected values from the repayment strategies not meet the required interest only amount. Any additional strategy must be held and valued in £GBP.


35. INCOME

We will verify income on every application. Income must be paid and contracted in GBP (£) and be subject to UK tax and National Insurance contributions.

37. UMBRELLA COMPANIES
------------------
Contractors using an umbrella company for payroll services can be considered where:
  • They’ve been contracting for longer than 12 months
  • Earnings are over £50,000.
The annualised assessable income is calculated on the basis of:
  • The last 3 months’ payslips (from the umbrella company) showing the contractor’s:
  • Basic pay
  • Holiday pay, and
  • Any additional pay e.g. commission
  • An average of the last 3 months’ pay at 80% of the gross income earned **after all the umbrella deductions have been made** (such as employer National Insurance, umbrella margin and apprenticeship levy). These umbrella costs may be shown separately on a reconciliation statement often attached to the payslips
  • Copies of all contracts covering last 12 months (there should be no gaps between contracts greater than one month)
  • Clients who employ the services of an umbrella company but are not contractors can be considered. They'll be assessed as self-employed subject to us verifying income for the latest 2 financial years with a minimum of 3 year’s trading. We'll normally use an average of the 2 years’ income or the most recent year whichever is lower.
Please see our **[packaging requirements](/packaging-requirements/ "Packaging Requirements")** for further requirements.


38. SELF EMPLOYED
-------------
Self employed applicants must have been trading for a minimum of 3 years but only the last 2 years' figures will be used. For self employed applicants affected by Covid-19, we’ll also need to confirm they’ve resumed trading. We'll request their latest business bank statement to evidence recent trading activity. We may request additional documentation to support our underwriting assessment, including cases where applicants haven’t restarted trading yet.
Contractors can continue to apply as self employed under existing criteria, or as a contractor. Details of the contractor criteria can be found under Contractors.


39. SECOND JOBS
-----------
We can consider using income from applicants with second jobs. The applicant must have held the 2 positions for at least 12 months.
Second incomes do not need to be in the same line of employment. Our underwriters will assess whether the income quality is adequate and if so, it will be included within the assessable income.


40. PENSION INCOME
--------------
Pension income may be used to support a mortgage advance, as long as it can be fully verified and guaranteed for life.


41. MAINTENANCE INCOME
------------------
We will accept up to 100% of child maintenance income. However it cannot be the only form of income on an application.
Any children associated with the maintenance payments should be entered as financial dependents.
To verify income we'll need the latest 3 months’ bank statements showing receipt of payments on all cases.
**We'll also need 1 of the following:**
  • a copy of a Court Order
  • Maintenance Assessment letter from the Child Support Agency
  • a written private agreement drawn up between the separating parties.
If any payment has been missed in that period, then the income cannot be used as part of the affordability assessment.


42. INVESTMENT OR RENTAL INCOME
---------------------------
Investment income is not acceptable.
Rental income will not normally be considered as allowable income unless it can be treated as an ongoing business, and criteria for self-employed applicants will apply.
Income generated from land and property will be calculated by deducting the total amount of ‘relief for finance costs’ from the ‘taxable profit for the year’ (in line with current tax calculation requirements).


43. FIXED TERM CONTRACTS
--------------------
Fixed term contracts are treated on merit and in context of each individual case. If the income is to be used in our assessment of affordability we would typically want the applicant to be able to demonstrate:
  • Evidence of previous contract renewal
  • Not all the income is dependent on a fixed term contract, for example a joint application with 1 applicant on a fixed term contract
  • A sufficient remaining period on the contract to warrant the approval of a long term loan.


44. EMPLOYED
--------
We will normally use 100% of contractually guaranteed income and the inclusion of non-guaranteed income (such as bonuses or regular commission) can be considered up to 50%. For non-guaranteed income to be considered we would need to evidence a track record of it being received and satisfy ourselves that it will be ongoing and sustainable.
Our underwriters have some discretion to use a different proportion of variable earnings but a historic record of these earnings will normally be required in order to exceed 50%, typically 3 years.
We'll take into consideration employment type and sector when considering ongoing sustainability.
We'll assess the latest P60 and the year to date income and will normally use the lowest figure.
If variable earnings are high we may ask for further documentation to evidence track record and future sustainability.
For bonus payments, we'll require evidence of the actual bonus paid.
Share awards, for example Restricted Stock Units will not be considered as bonuses and therefore cannot be used as variable income.

======================================================================
NEW EMPLOYMENT
======================================================================

To consider income from a new role we would need:
  • The new position to be in the same line of employment as current role
  • Proof of new position and salary via the new job offer or accepted contract
  • A condition of the mortgage offer may be receipt of the first payslip to confirm the applicant has started the new employment before we release the funds.

======================================================================
A CONFIRMED PAY RISE
======================================================================

We’ll consider using income from a future pay rise subject to confirmation from the employer (such as a reference or pay rise notification).
We may request proof that the pay rise has taken effect where we can’t adequately confirm the salary increase.


45. DIRECTORS WITH A SHAREHOLDING OF 25% OR GREATER
-----------------------------------------------
We normally use the latest years’ director’s salary, plus an average of the latest 2 years’ dividends or the most recent year if lower.


46. CRYPTOCURRENCY
--------------
Income from cryptocurrency is not acceptable. Minor trading that is classed as a hobby may be acceptable but each case will be considered on its merits.


47. JOINT BORROWER, SOLE PROPRIETOR
-------------------------------
We'll consider joint borrower/sole proprietor applications through our First Start product. You can find more information on our [First Start Information](/first-start-information/ "First Start Information") page.
We can't consider joint borrower/sole proprietor applications on our standard products.


48. LENDING INTO RETIREMENT
-----------------------
Where term extends into the applicants retirement the following criteria will apply.
**Where retirement is less than 10 years away:**
  • Details of both current income and anticipated retirement income will need to be proven
  • The lower of the current income or anticipated retirement income is used for affordability purposes.
**Where retirement is 10 years or more away:**
  • Current income is to be used for affordability purposes
  • Evidence of existence pension contributions must be provided.


49. LOAN SIZE AND LOAN TO VALUE LIMITS
----------------------------------
The following limits apply to both purchases and remortgages and are **subject to product availability**. Please note the minimum loan size is £25,001.

Not acceptable on purchases. Remortgages for purchase of final equity share only.
Property location |
We do not usually lend on properties that are next to, opposite, above or close to commercial premises or anything that may prohibit the peaceful enjoyment of the property.

However, if the property is in a highly desirable area we may be able to consider it, so please [contact us](https://www.bankofireland4intermediaries.co.uk/contact-us/ "Contact us") prior to application.
Flats in high rise developments
|
Can be considered.
For properties purchased in residential housing blocks that have cladding/stacked balconies, we may refer the property to our Property Risk Team at an earlier stage in the application. We may request the Fire Risk Assessment (FRA) and Fire Risk External Wall Assessment (FRAEW) reports for the building where the property is located prior to instructing the valuation. Once the reports are received our Property Risk Team will assess and advise if the property is acceptable to us.
A FRA/FRAEW report may also be recommended by our valuer when inspecting the property.
When we request the reports, please provide:
1. The current Fire Risk Assessment (FRA) report for the building (not a report recommending a review, the date of which has already passed).
2. The current Fire Risk External Wall (external façade) Assessment (FRAEW) report for the building (not a report recommending a review, the date of which has already passed).
3. The name and qualifications of the author of each of these reports, together with (if possible) a copy of the certificate confirming those qualifications. It's essential that we have these qualifications provided.
Please refer to our [fire risk assessments criteria](/lending-criteria/#fire-risk-assessments) for acceptable qualifications for FRA & FRAEW reports.
For properties over 10 storeys, please contact us with details of the property prior to submission for a decision in principle.

Minimum leasehold requirements
|
All leasehold properties require a **minimum of 85 years** at the start of the mortgage term.
Onerous lease terms
|
Not acceptable.
The Bank will consider lending on properties with escalating ground rent clauses, however it will not lend upon properties with onerous leases. The Bank itself will not determine whether a lease is onerous or not. It relies on its panel valuers and conveyancers to advise on the onerous nature of a lease. This is based upon their professional knowledge and experience of both leases and the local housing market, since it is the market which determines this property attribute.
As far as ground rents are concerned, increases in line with RPI (or equivalent indexes) are generally acceptable to the Bank. However, multiplier increases will need to be referred to both the valuer and conveyancer, particularly if the multiplier is for a time period of less than every 25 years. The Bank’s professional advisers will consider market appetite for ground rent increases, which will vary from location to location.
Properties with occupancy restrictions
|
Not acceptable.
Properties being acquired under assignable contract
|
Not acceptable.
Properties with communal heating, hot water or other services where the property is not individually metered

If the applicant has in the last 6 years substantially altered, refurbished, remodelled or extended their property please [contact us](https://www.bankofireland4intermediaries.co.uk/contact-us/ "contact us") prior to application.

100% flat roofs on blocks of flats/apartments are generally acceptable.


78. ROOFS WITH SINGLE DIRECTION PITCH (MONO-PITCH)
----------------------------------------------
Roofs which are pitched in a single direction and have materials more commonly used on flat roofed properties, such as felt, asphalt or similar materials, will need to comply with our policy for 100% flat roofs (see below).
For semi-detached and terraced houses, party walls must extend above any flat roof covering between the properties for the property to be acceptable to us.


79. RESIDENCY STATUS
----------------
All applicants must be resident in the UK prior to applying. The applicant will need to have lived in the UK for long enough to ensure we have a meaningful credit score and employment history. This is normally a minimum of 3 years. Please see the Foreign Nationals section for any rights to live and work in the UK.

  • income from cryptocurrency trading
  • vendor/builder cashback without additional minimum deposit from an acceptable source.


81. SCOTLAND
--------
In Scotland, if it is public knowledge a property is for sale, the seller in most cases must provide a Home Report to prospective buyers. There are some exceptional situations when a seller can choose not to provide a potential purchaser with the Home Report and cases where a Home Report is not actually required. Further information can be found at https://www.mygov.scot/buying-a-home/home-report
For applications where no Home Report is required or available, we'll instruct a mortgage valuation.
The Home Report contains the Property Questionnaire, Single Survey, and an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC); the majority will also contain a Generic Mortgage Valuation Report (GMVR).
For purchase applications we'll request a transcript of the GMVR from the valuer who prepared the original Home Report. That valuer must be on the Bank of Ireland Panel. We'll only accept transcripts from Home Reports that are no more than 12 weeks old. It is the seller’s responsibility to obtain a refreshed Home Report if this is older than 12 weeks.
The transcript we receive is valid throughout the offer period and a Home Report refresh is not required. If the offer expires and an offer extension is required, then we'll require a revaluation which the applicant must pay for.
To get the correct product and Loan to Value (where the purchase price is different from the Home Report) you should key the application with the lower of the valuation or purchase price and then in the additional information box put a note on to say what the correct purchase price is. The application must also include the name of the firm that completed the Home Report and the date when the Home Report was undertaken.
If the firm is on our panel and the Home Report in date, then a transcript can be instructed.
If the firm is not on panel, then a Standard valuation would be required, but if the product does not include a fees free valuation or the fees free valuation has already been used, then a valuation fee payment must be taken first.
Missives covers the exchange of correspondence between the purchaser’s and seller’s solicitors negotiating the conditions of the sale. Property transactions in Scotland become legally binding for all parties upon ‘conclusion of Missives’.
**Scottish Private Residential Tenancies (PRT)**
Scottish Private Residential Tenancies (PRT) are acceptable and we'll instruct a mortgage valuation.
**Tenure**
Tenure - typically referred to as Former Feudal, Simple/Absolute ownership is accepted.
Applications can be considered for security on the following Scottish Islands;
Lewis and Harris, Mainland Shetland, Mainland Orkney, Skye, Bute, Arran, Islay, Mull, Whalsay, Yell, South Ronaldsay, West Burra, Tiree and Unst.
Where the valuer identifies a flat with potentially combustible cladding and/or stacked balconies which could facilitate the spread of fire, we'll require the Fire Risk Assessment report (FRA) and Fire Risk Assessment External Walls (FRAEW), together with the names and qualifications of the authors of these documents, for the building. Once we have all of this information, our Property Risk team will assess and advise if acceptable to proceed.
We do not accept EWS1 forms for properties with cladding/stacked balconies.
Please refer to our [fire risk assessments criteria](/lending-criteria/#fire-risk-assessments) for acceptable qualifications for FRA & FRAEW reports.
All properties 10 storeys or higher must be referred to our Property Risk Team prior to application. Please [contact us](https://www.bankofireland4intermediaries.co.uk/contact-us/).


82. SOLICITORS AND LICENSED CONVEYANCERS
------------------------------------
Please see our [**solicitors and licensed conveyancers**](/working-with-us/using-solicitors-and-licensed-conveyancers/ "Using solicitors and licensed conveyancers") page.


83. TERM
----
  • The maximum term is 35 years
  • The minimum term is 5 years (or term of promotional period for existing customers moving home).


84. VALUATION TRANSCRIPTS
---------------------
**Where we are approached by an applicant with a request to accept a retype, consideration will only be given in the following circumstances:**
  • Valuation must have been carried out within the past 4 weeks (12 weeks for a Scottish purchase)
  • The valuer who carried out the original report must be on Bank of Ireland UK’s panel for the postcode in which the property is located
  • The previous valuation must have been carried out for another lender
  • A copy of the valuation report must be provided to Valuation Services before any retype can be agreed
  • The requested retype must be for the same applicant
  • It must also be for the same product type
  • The valuation fee will be the agreed panel fee. This is non-refundable once the valuation has been completed.


85. VENDOR DEPOSITS
---------------
Vendor paid deposits for second hand properties will be deducted from the gross purchase price to give a true net purchase price. Our maximum LTV lending will be based on this lower sum.


86. VALUATION APPEAL
----------------
Where an appeal against a valuation is requested we’ll need evidence of 3 transactions of similar properties (comparables) to be submitted within 14 working days from the date you were aware of the valuation.
Where appealing both rent and capital values, we’ll need 3 comparables for each.
These should be completed sales or lettings within the last 6 months of similar properties and locations, ideally in the same postcode.
**The following information will need to be provided for each comparable item*:**
  • Full address (i.e. house or flat number and postcode)
  • Details of who sold or let the property
  • The agreed sale price or rent
  • Date of the transaction
  • Source of information.
For any valuation decision queries please get in touch with us via [case message](https://www2.mortgageapplicationservice.co.uk/dist/BOI/login/).
_*We don’t accept links to web adverts. Estate Agent letters, automated valuations, details of unsold/unlet properties and previous Valuer’s opinions aren’t considered appropriate evidence and will not be considered._


87. VALUATION - ESSENTIAL REPAIRS
-----------------------------
If a valuation report is received and the survey does not provide a current market value due to a recommendation that specialist reports are required, please be aware of the following:
  • The application **may still be declined** even after the reports have been received if there is an issue with the property that does not meet our lending policy
  • If there are any recommended works stipulated within the specialist reports, these works **must be completed** before we can proceed with the application

Row 9:
  Property description: Flats in high rise developments
  Criteria: Can be considered. For properties purchased in residential housing blocks that have cladding/stacked balconies, we may refer the property to our Property Risk Team at an earlier stage in the application. We may request the Fire Risk Assessment (FRA) and Fire Risk External Wall Assessment (FRAEW) reports for the building where the property is located prior to instructing the valuation. Once the reports are received our Property Risk Team will assess and advise if the property is acceptable to us. A FRA/FRAEW report may also be recommended by our valuer when inspecting the property. When we request the reports, please provide: The current Fire Risk Assessment (FRA) report for the building (not a report recommending a review, the date of which has already passed).

Row 18:
  Property description: Onerous lease terms
  Criteria: Not acceptable. The Bank will consider lending on properties with escalating ground rent clauses, however it will not lend upon properties with onerous leases. The Bank itself will not determine whether a lease is onerous or not. It relies on its panel valuers and conveyancers to advise on the onerous nature of a lease. This is based upon their professional knowledge and experience of both leases and the local housing market, since it is the market which determines this property attribute. As far as ground rents are concerned, increases in line with RPI (or equivalent indexes) are generally acceptable to the Bank. However, multiplier increases will need to be referred to both the valuer and conveyancer, particularly if the multiplier is for a time period of less than every 25 years. The Banks professional advisers will consider market appetite for ground rent increases, which will vary from location to location.
