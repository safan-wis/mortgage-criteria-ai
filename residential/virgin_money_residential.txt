##### New mortgage applications

### Multi storey buildings which have multiple occupancy and are either:

• Under 11 metres AND 4 storeys or less, anywhere in the UK, or

• 11 metres or more OR 5 storeys or more, in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland

• Under 11 metres AND 4 storeys or less, anywhere in the UK, or

• 11 metres or more OR 5 storeys or more, in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland

Our valuation policy will ensure that a professional valuation is undertaken for these properties. Where the valuer has fire safety concerns with the External Wall System or any other fire safety concerns, they will request a completed External Wall Fire Review Form (EWS1), in line with RICS guidance. Our appointed valuer will check their database to confirm the property’s EWS1 status. Where they are unable to do so, we will request the EWS1 form. The EWS1 form should be sent directly to us.

The EWS1 form is the responsibility of the building owner (property owner in Scotland) to undertake. They must appoint a qualified member of one of the appropriate professional bodies to complete and sign the form. The form will confirm that the EWS has been assessed and provide its safety rating. The rating will determine whether we are able to progress the case.

A rating of A1, A2 or B1 will mean that the valuer will determine whether the case can progress and where acceptable, provide an amended valuation report.

A rating of A3 or B2 will mean that the property will be declined where affected by cladding and remediation is required.

### Multi storey buildings in England which have multiple occupancy and are either:

• 11 metres or more, or

• Have 5 or more storeys

• 11 metres or more, or

• Have 5 or more storeys

Where a valuer has identified any significant fire safety concerns, or the EWS1 form rating is either A3 or B2, they’ll let us know if remediation of the property has been agreed to be funded by either Government funding or by the Developer, if known. We’ll then get in touch requesting the following:

• An executed Leaseholder Deed of Certificate.

• An executed Landlord Certificate (for applications where the building is being fully remediated under the Building Safety Act or by the Developer, this certificate will not be required).

• An executed Leaseholder Deed of Certificate.

• An executed Landlord Certificate (for applications where the building is being fully remediated under the Building Safety Act or by the Developer, this certificate will not be required).

Please note that we aren’t accepting applications fromnon-qualifying leaseholdersfor buildings that are not being remediated under the Building Safety Act.

We must be satisfied with the information provided to allow us to proceed. You can find more guidance on this documentation on thegovernment website.

##### Existing mortgages

We are here to support our existing customers who have a mortgage on a property that is impacted by potentially unsafe EWS. When their current mortgage deal ends we will offer a new mortgage product, just as we always would.

For changes to an existing Virgin Money mortgage we will assess each case based on individual circumstances. As a responsible lender, any application for additional borrowing from customers impacted by unsafe EWS will be carefully considered before a decision is made.

For any other questions about EWS please refer to theFAQsprovided by RCIS or visit theGovernment’s websiteto view their guidance on cladding.

12. Deposit
   Link: #deposit
============================================================

# Deposit

##### Gifted deposits

Gifted deposits, such as money gifted by family, are acceptable. Vendor gifted deposits are only acceptable fornew build.

##### Let-to-buy deposits

A deposit from alet-to-buyis acceptable. We do not require simultaneous completion (unless both the BTL and residential transactions of a let-to-buy are being mortgaged with Virgin Money).

### Deposits from capital raising against other properties are also acceptable.

##### New builds

For new builds, we allow cash incentives up to 5% of the purchase price up to 90% LTV without affecting the loan amount. If greater than 5%, the balance of the incentive above 5% must be deducted from the purchase price when calculating the maximum loan amount. Where the LTV on a Shared Ownership case is greater than 90%, cash incentives must be deducted from the purchase price when calculating the maximum loan amount.

##### Loans

Deposits from loans are only acceptable subject to underwriter assessment. There must be no charge placed on the property we are lending on. Where the deposit is from a loan, this should be confirmed as the source of deposit in the application, and the associated expenditure and repayment terms declared. This includes loans from financial institutions or individuals, such as family members. Just so you know, we won’t usually consider scenarios where the deposit is entirely from a loan.

##### Forces HTB

### Forces HTB loans are accepted as a source of deposit. See ourForces HTB criteria.

##### Gifted equity

### Gifted equity is acceptable when buying from a family member. See ourdiscounted purchase criteria.

##### ROSCA

Deposits sourced from Rotating Savings and Credit Associations (ROSCA), such as an open cooperative funding circle scheme, are not acceptable.

##### Evidence

We do not usually require proof of deposit to be provided. The legal rep will confirm the deposit as part of their due diligence. If the deposit is gifted, we require agifted deposit form.


13. Discounted purchase
   Link: #discounted-purchase
============================================================

# Discounted purchase

Also known as a concessionary purchase, an undervalue purchase or use of gifted equity as deposit for a purchase is acceptable when buying from a family member. The seller cannot live in the property after it has been sold.

##### How it works

The LTV will be calculated on the property value instead of the purchase price and we will not lend more than the discounted purchase price.

For example, on a property valued at £200,000 sold at a discount for £150,000, we’d lend up to £150,000 and calculate the LTV as 75%.

##### Conditions

The legal rep must establish that the family member selling the property is not insolvent and/or arrange suitable indemnity insurance for the full value of the property, and the buyer and seller must have separate legal representation.

We will need a letter from the family member(s) gifting the equity to confirm that it is a gift and they do not expect to be repaid during the recipient’s ownership of the property or on its sale.

Overpayments and/or lump sum payments are allowed in combination up to 10% of the mortgage balance during each year of the fixed rate product without incurring an early repayment charge. Fully flexible products allow unlimited overpayments / lump sum payments.

##### Overpayments

Customers can request to add a regular monthly overpayment amount to their monthly payment by contacting us. Following a product transfer or if the product is ported then the overpayment amount will be removed and will need to be set up again.

##### Lump sum payments

Lump sum payments can only be lodged once the first payment has been credited to the mortgage account.

It is important to note that your customer’s regular payment will not automatically reduce following a lump sum payment. They can request a payment reduction by contacting us.


18. Existing customers - porting
   Link: #existing-customers---porting
============================================================

# Existing customers - porting

### All our on-sale products can be ported.

Where the full balance is not ported to the new property the amount the balance has been reduced by will be subject to any applicable Early Repayment Charges.

The new mortgage can exceed the product LTV for the original application but must be within Virgin Money’s maximum loan to value limits.

Virgin Money will consider applications where customers wish to port their existing product to a property that they already own. This includes properties mortgaged to Virgin Money, another lender or owned outright.

If your customer requires additional borrowing to purchase their next property, they will be able to apply for a new product for the additional amount from the product range available at that time. Broker exclusive products can’t be used for this additional borrowing.

##### Existing customers moving home and taking an entirely new product

All customers who are moving home also have the option to take a new mortgage product from our prevailing range for the entire loan for their new property. Provided the new loan completes within three months of redemption of the existing loan, they may receive a refund of 50% on any applicable Early Repayment Charge.

##### Customers redeeming and completing on different days

If a customer doesn't complete the loan on the next property on the same day as they repay the loan on their current property, then any applicable Early Repayment Charge will be payable in full on the day of redemption. If they complete the loan on the next property within three months of redeeming, then the Early Repayment Charge will be refunded. If there is a reduction in the balance, any applicable Early Repayment Charge will be payable on the difference.

If your customer’s expected completion date on their new property is within 90 days of their product maturity, we will allow the customer to select a new product without incurring an early repayment charge, this will prevent your customer from having to port their mortgage product and then undertake a product transfer application in quick succession. If there is a reduction in the balance, any applicable Early Repayment Charge will still be payable on the difference.

Please refer to the Offer documentation issued to your customer for confirmation of their terms and conditions when moving home.

##### Customers who need to change the parties named on the mortgage when moving home

Forces HTB is a scheme open to serving members of the armed forces allowing them to borrow up to 50% of their annual salary up to £25,000 interest free. Funds can be used towards a deposit and fees for a residential purchase and are repaid in equal instalments over a 10 year period, deducted from salary with a small insurance premium.

### We accept the Forces HTB loan as a residential mortgage deposit.

When applying, please select ‘Other’ as the source of deposit, and use the box that appears to tell us it’s ‘Forces HTB’.

It’s important to include the Forces HTB loan and insurance payments as expenditure so we know how much the customer will be paying. In the ‘Financial Details’ section please declare the loan under ‘Existing Loan Details’ as an ‘Unsecured’ commitment and include the insurance cost under ‘Monthly Outgoings’ as ‘Insurance & Investments’.

This can be pre-offer or post-offer, up until we have received the Certificate of Title from the solicitor. We can’t make changes to the product after the COT has been received.
