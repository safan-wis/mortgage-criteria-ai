Affordability
Interest coverage ratio (ICR)
The minimum amount of rental cover (ICR) is dependent on the applicant’s income tax band (highest tax band on joint applications) at the rates shown below:
Basic rate taxpayers: 125%
Higher and additional rate taxpayers: 140%
Limited companies: 125%
The applicant’s tax band should be based on all validated current income plus gross rental income (excluding any deductions) from all rental properties, including the security. Refer to our buy to let calculator for further guidance.
The interest rate used in the ICR calculation is determined by the chosen product as follows:
5 year fixed rates assessed at product rate
Variable rates or short-term fixed rates assessed at product rate plus 2%. Minimum 5.50%
Where the applicant is remortgaging an existing buy to let loan without additional capital raising, then the ICR can be calculated using the product rate for applications up to 80% LTV gross
Where more than the rental income is needed to meet the minimum rental cover requirements, we may reduce the loan amount accordingly

Proof of other income
Proof of other income sources
During underwriting we may ask for the following evidence where these have been included in top slicing applications:
Tax credits: all pages of their latest Final Tax Credits award
Second job: see requirements relevant to the type of employment for their second job
Maintenance: copy of their current court order (must have a minimum of three years left to run)
Rental income: last full month’s bank statement
Intercompany loan
This is acceptable for limited company lending subject to:
Majority shareholder to mirror SPV and connected company
Must be UK to UK company (no offshore companies)
Loan is repayable and a term agreed and evidenced with a copy of the signed loan agreement
Rate of interest applied should be HMRC’s ordinary rate of interest
Any monthly payment will be used within the ICR calculation
Connected company is not to have any interest or charge over the property
Minimum earned income
Where all applicants are first-time buyers, at least one applicant must have a minimum income of £30,000
No minimum income requirements on loans under £1m, but applicants will need to be able to cover rental voids should they arise
For loans over £1m, a minimum income of £100,000 is required from at least one applicant
Income can be from multiple sources associated with the individual; proof of income must be provided
We won't accept aggregated income of £100,000 across multiple applicants

Affordability
Interest coverage ratio (ICR)
The minimum amount of rental cover (ICR) is dependent on the applicant’s income tax band (highest tax band on joint applications) at the rates shown below:

The applicant’s tax band should be based on all validated current income plus gross rental income (excluding any deductions) from all rental properties, including the security. Refer to our buy to let calculator for further guidance.

5 year fixed rates assessed at product rate
Variable rates or short-term fixed rates assessed at product rate plus 2%. Minimum 5.50%
Where the applicant is remortgaging an existing buy to let loan without additional capital raising, then the ICR can be calculated using the product rate for applications up to 80% LTV gross
Where more than the rental income is needed to meet the minimum rental cover requirements, we may reduce the loan amount accordingly

Proof of other income
Proof of other income sources
During underwriting we may ask for the following evidence where these have been included in top slicing applications:
Tax credits: all pages of their latest Final Tax Credits award
Second job: see requirements relevant to the type of employment for their second job
Maintenance: copy of their current court order (must have a minimum of three years left to run)
Rental income: last full month’s bank statement
Intercompany loan
This is acceptable for limited company lending subject to:
Majority shareholder to mirror SPV and connected company
Must be UK to UK company (no offshore companies)
Loan is repayable and a term agreed and evidenced with a copy of the signed loan agreement
Rate of interest applied should be HMRC’s ordinary rate of interest
Any monthly payment will be used within the ICR calculation
Connected company is not to have any interest or charge over the property
Minimum earned income
Where all applicants are first-time buyers, at least one applicant must have a minimum income of £30,000
No minimum income requirements on loans under £1m, but applicants will need to be able to cover rental voids should they arise
For loans over £1m, a minimum income of £100,000 is required from at least one applicant
Income can be from multiple sources associated with the individual; proof of income must be provided
We won't accept aggregated income of £100,000 across multiple applicants

Affordability
Interest coverage ratio (ICR)
The minimum amount of rental cover (ICR) is dependent on the applicant’s income tax band (highest tax band on joint applications) at the rates shown below:
Basic rate taxpayers: 125%
Higher and additional rate taxpayers: 140%
Limited companies: 125%
The applicant’s tax band should be based on all validated current income plus gross rental income (excluding any deductions) from all rental properties, including the security. Refer to our buy to let calculator for further guidance.
The interest rate used in the ICR calculation is determined by the chosen product as follows:
5 year fixed rates assessed at product rate
Variable rates or short-term fixed rates assessed at product rate plus 2%. Minimum 5.50%
Where the applicant is remortgaging an existing buy to let loan without additional capital raising, then the ICR can be calculated using the product rate for applications up to 80% LTV gross
Where more than the rental income is needed to meet the minimum rental cover requirements, we may reduce the loan amount accordingly

Land Registry evidence of the first charge registration or charge application submission
the underwriter to be satisfied that the property is intended to be let
a physical inspection of the property to be carried out in all instances

Desktop valuations
Desktop valuations
To speed the process up, we'll complete a desktop valuation for remortgage applications on standard properties that meet our eligibility criteria – where this is not possible, we'll complete an in-person valuation
In some cases, we may not get enough information from the desktop valuation and may need to conduct a physical valuation. If that's the case, we'll contact the valuation contact provided in the application. We won't charge an additional valuation fee
We'll confirm the valuation type and fee during the application process
The following property types aren't eligible for a desktop valuation:
Flats/maisonettes/cottages
Specialist properties – HMOs and MUFBs
New builds and conversions
Properties under construction
Properties with a flying freehold element
Historic property (built before 1850)
Listed buildings
Land greater than one acre
Valuation
Valuations
We'll instruct a member of our valuer panel to undertake a security assessment and valuation report to determine the property value and the realistic, sustainable monthly rental income
The property needs to be habitable at the point of inspection by our surveyor
The valuer will be instructed to assess the property on an unfurnished basis
Valuations are valid for six months
A new valuation may be required where mortgage offers are extended
Validation
ID and residency documents
We'll attempt to electronically verify the identity of all applicants – if this fails we may require proof of name and/or address
If originals are not available, certified photocopies are acceptable if:
They're certified by an independent professional (e.g. FCA regulated broker, solicitor, accountant) and not by an applicant or relative
They're certified using the phrase 'This is a true copy of the original'
Where the document contains a photograph, they're certified using the phrase 'This is a true likeness of the applicant'
The full name of the person certifying the documents, firm/employer name, the address of the firm/employer, and their licence number (either FCA registration number, SRA registration number or ACCA registration number) must be clearly written on the certified copy
We retain the right to request original documentation
Refer to Anti-Money Laundering Guidelines for certification requirements and acceptable documents
Income verification, proof of deposit and account conduct
If any documentation is required to verify income, deposit or account conduct, we'll tell you during the online application.
Bank statements
Where we request bank statements these must show salary or self-employed income, household utilities, daily expenditure and current mortgage or rent payments
