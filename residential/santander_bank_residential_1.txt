Consideration of any application is primarily based on your client's ability to repay the mortgage loan. Calculation of the amount we'll lend to your client is based on assessing affordability. The affordability calculator is available on our website. Current credit commitments must be included when assessing affordability even if they're being repaid as part of the transaction. For example, a loan or credit card being repaid from equity in the property. However, the following credit commitments don't need to be included: Please note that if your client has a financial agreement which has a balloon payment associated to it, this must always be declared as a financial commitment. To make sure a realistic figure is used for affordability purposes, the system will automatically use 100% of primary income and a maximum of 70% of secondary income, to calculate the net monthly income figures. The table below shows the income types considered. Primary income is income that is permanent, monthly, reliable, sustainable and regular. Secondary income is income that, whilst not permanent or guaranteed, is nevertheless regular and sustainable. Please note that applications will be subject to additional policy including maximum income multiples and debt:income ratios. Income types 1. Dividends can’t exceed your client's share of profit (after tax) and should be capped to net profit. 2. Please refer to our evidence requirements guide for further details and requirements. 3. Where either the benefit recipient or their partner's total gross income is above £60,000, child benefit must not be included as a source of income. Arrears in the previous 12 months aren't acceptable. Any client who has ever been bankrupt will be declined. The following provides examples of the types of application that fall into our credit scores. Low scoring applications may be declined. If you wish to appeal a declined AIP or FMA, please speak to your dedicated contact. Regular expenditure items need to be included to assess affordability. To include: We'll consider applications where any element of employed income is paid in any of the following foreign currencies: The sterling equivalent must be calculated and discounted by 25% to allow for currency fluctuations. This figure must be input into the £ equivalent field in Introducer Internet. You must record in the general notes within the Regulation Section in the full mortgage application in Introducer Internet: The table below shows our maximum income multiples. Income may be a combination of primary and secondary incomes: Some payslip deductions where your client confirms the deduction is discretionary may be excluded from our affordability assessment, subject to confirmation in the Introducer Internet general notes. Non-discretionary deductions, e.g. company pension contributions, student loans, season ticket loans, childcare vouchers, can't be excluded from the affordability assessment. We don't accept applications where your client advises they'll cancel a company pension scheme to support affordability. We may request proof of deposit where we want to know more about the source of the funds e.g. a first time buyer putting down a large deposit. We accept Help to Buy: ISA as a source of deposit for first time buyers. We don’t accept deposit funds originating either from a child’s bank account/trustee account, or funds transferred directly from a business bank account without having been declared as personal income. Where deposit funds originate from outside of the United Kingdom, you'll be required to state the origin of your client's funds and additional checks may apply. Please refer to our evidence requirements > proof of deposit section for a list of countries/jurisdictions from where we don't accept deposit funds. We can accept deposits provided by gift or loan. Gifted deposit We won't accept a gifted deposit if: The list above isn't exhaustive, so there may be other instances where we won't accept a gifted deposit. The use of a second charge could indicate the amount provided isn't a gift and further clarification may be required. We don't allow a second charge on any flexible mortgage products. For gifted deposit applications where the funds are received from abroad, there are some additional requirements we may ask for to evidence the deposit. Please refer to our evidence requirements > proof of deposit section for more details. Loan Where the source of deposit is a loan, you should give us the following details in the notes section on Introducer Internet: We don't accept deposits funded from a Santander personal loan.

• Be a UK resident; and
• The property must be for their own use and immediate occupation.

• Temporarily overseas (e.g. BFPO, offshore worker) and returning to live in the property at an end date; or
• Not fully occupying but the property would be:- Partially occupied e.g. sole applicant working overseas during the week but residing in the property at weekends- Split occupation e.g. one joint party resides in property and the other is abroad- Family occupied – e.g. dependent relative such as spouse/parent/sibling resides but with no formal letting agreement. Purchase applications only. Remortgage applications aren't permitted.

Maximum of 2 clients per application. If the application includes a person who is going to be living in the property and they're also providing a lump sum towards the purchase, that person must be included on the application and appear on the mortgage. If there will be a person over age 17 living in the property who isn't on the mortgage, they must sign our Deed of Consent and Charge to postpone/charge to Santander any occupancy right or interest they may have in the property. This Deed is on the reverse of our Mortgage Deed (Standard Security in Scotland). Where your client has just 1 name (first name or surname), either on their birth certificate or because they changed it by deed poll, input 'XXX' into the surname field within the Agreement in Principle on Introducer Internet. AIV is a method we use to verify your client's stated income by comparing Current Account Turnover sourced from Credit Reference Agencies. Where we use AIV, we confirm this at the full mortgage application decision stage in Introducer Internet and you must: If you resubmit a case or there's a material change, we check the eligibility for AIV. If we don't use AIV, we confirm what income evidence you need to upload to support the application. Our detailed income evidence requirements are set out on our website. We reserve the right to request this evidence. Intermediaries are required to act appropriately where an application represents a potential conflict of interest situation. This applies to both new business and product transfer applications. You can't deal with an application in your own name. This includes acting as the accountant for your self-employed applications where you're a qualified accountant. For firms where there is no independent person to process the application and validate all necessary documentation, the application will need to be submitted through another firm. We'll consider clients on non-permanent employment contracts. We don't accept applications from clients with a criminal record (or where they're living with someone who has), unless the conviction is for a minor traffic offence, or is spent under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974. We don't accept cryptocurrencies as a source of deposit. All new mortgage applications submitted must provide a personal email address and mobile number for each client. If your client is unable or unwilling to provide this information through the intermediary application process and they still wish to apply for a Santander mortgage, they’ll need to contact Santander directly by phone. At the time of application, your clients must: We'll accept applications on an execution only basis for high net worth clients and Mortgage Professionals. For an application to be considered on an execution only basis your clients must meet the following criteria: Evidence of eligibility to proceed with execution only must be obtained from your client. We'll undertake regular monthly checks with a sample of intermediaries to check that they comply with the above criteria. If your client already has a Santander mortgage, there are a couple of options available to them when they're moving home. Porting Porting is when an existing Santander mortgage customer moves home and transfers their mortgage product for the rest of its term. Most of our products are portable. It's possible to ‘port’ most existing products to a new mortgage as long as it's for house purchase/home ownership but not to a property being remortgaged or owned mortgage-free. Your client's right to port their mortgage product is always subject to the conditions for transferring the loan to a new mortgage in their Mortgage Terms and Conditions. In particular, any new mortgage application made will be subject to a full credit check and the customer/property must meet our lending criteria at the time of the new application. If we don't agree a new mortgage, your client won't be able to port their mortgage product and they may then need to pay an early repayment charge (ERC) if they then redeem their existing mortgage. Where redemption of the existing mortgage and purchase of the new property isn't simultaneous, as long as the purchase of the new property completes within 3 months of the redemption date, the existing product can be ported to the new mortgage. Any additional borrowing must come from the new business mortgage product range. Where your client is porting their existing mortgage to a new build property, they’ll receive a refund of the ERC in line with the criteria above, if the purchase of the new property completes within 6 months of the redemption date. Where your client chooses to port their Flexible Offset mortgage to a new property, the sale and purchase must be simultaneous. The 3 month ERC waiver window doesn't apply (because there's no ERC). Choosing a new product Existing Santander mortgage customers moving home can choose a new business product for their total borrowing. Where they’re currently tied in: You'll need to inform your client that they must tell their solicitor to deduct the full or partial percentage of ERC waiver from the redemption monies if redemption and completion are simultaneous. If completion is non-simultaneous, your client must pay the full ERC due on redemption. As long as completion of the new mortgage is within 3 months of redemption, your client can then request a refund of the full or partial ERC. A client who has never owned a property, whether in the UK or abroad. On joint applications all clients must meet the definition. We consider applications from non-UK/non-Irish nationals where the property is for their own use and for immediate occupation. These may be subject to full underwriting. We don't accept applications from foreign nationals holding diplomatic immunity. For applications where the LTV is over 75% and your client's income is required for affordability purposes, they must have the permanent right to reside in the UK e.g. indefinite leave to enter (ILE) or remain in the UK (ILR) or settled or pre-settled status (EEA/Swiss citizens). This must be supported by 1 of the following: Further information may be available from www.gov.uk/browse/visas-immigration/settle-in-the-uk We don't accept guarantor applications. A Confirmation of Verification of Identity Certificate must be completed and meet the requirements set out within the Joint Money Laundering Steering Group Guidance for the UK Financial Sector. We reserve the right to ask for additional client information, including identity evidence, where it's deemed necessary. For lending over 90% LTV, your client will need to meet the following criteria: For LTV restrictions please refer to the 'Types and purpose of loans where we lend' section. We consider applications where the mortgage term doesn't exceed: Retired clients We treat clients as retired if they receive retirement income and aren’t reliant on income from employment or self-employment at the time of application. In these cases, there’s no intended retirement age. Subject to our maximum age policy at the end of the mortgage term, we can consider applications from retired clients. Existing Santander mortgage customers moving home: In all cases we undertake regular checks to assess the plausibility of your client's selected or anticipated age of retirement and we may request further information or evidence to support this. Please refer to the 'Existing mortgage customers moving home' section for more information. We don't accept applications where the property is being purchased by, from or connected to a Property Investment Club. All clients must: Exceptions to this policy are clients who meet 1 of the following scenarios: Where your client's shareholding in a company (or combined shareholding of all clients) is 20% or more, treat your client as self-employed. Where your client's shareholding in a company (or combined shareholding of all clients) is less than 20%, treat your client as employed. For family business employment, we require bank statements evidencing the latest 3 months' salary credits. We won't accept applications from clients who have been self-employed or owned their business for less than 2 years. Where accounts are marked with a negative 'going concern' qualification the application will be declined. We can consider income from alphabet share ownership for a director of a limited company. Please see our evidence requirements guide for more information. All mortgage applications are required to use a solicitor from the Santander panel. To find an appropriate local solicitor please use the solicitor search facility on our website. Clients who can't be traced on the voter's roll for the years they have lived at a property, may be considered subject to a letter from the local authority confirming they had registered for those years. For clients who didn't register at the address a written explanation should be obtained and submitted for consideration.

## Applicants and over 17s living in the property
Maximum of 2 clients per application. If the application includes a person who is going to be living in the property and they're also providing a lump sum towards the purchase, that person must be included on the application and appear on the mortgage. If there will be a person over age 17 living in the property who isn't on the mortgage, they must sign our Deed of Consent and Charge to postpone/charge to Santander any occupancy right or interest they may have in the property. This Deed is on the reverse of our Mortgage Deed (Standard Security in Scotland). Where your client has just 1 name (first name or surname), either on their birth certificate or because they changed it by deed poll, input 'XXX' into the surname field within the Agreement in Principle on Introducer Internet.

## Automated Income Verification (AIV)
AIV is a method we use to verify your client's stated income by comparing Current Account Turnover sourced from Credit Reference Agencies. Where we use AIV, we confirm this at the full mortgage application decision stage in Introducer Internet and you must: If you resubmit a case or there's a material change, we check the eligibility for AIV. If we don't use AIV, we confirm what income evidence you need to upload to support the application. Our detailed income evidence requirements are set out on our website. We reserve the right to request this evidence.

## Conflict of interest
Intermediaries are required to act appropriately where an application represents a potential conflict of interest situation. This applies to both new business and product transfer applications. You can't deal with an application in your own name. This includes acting as the accountant for your self-employed applications where you're a qualified accountant. For firms where there is no independent person to process the application and validate all necessary documentation, the application will need to be submitted through another firm.

## Contractors
We'll consider clients on non-permanent employment contracts.

## Criminal record
We don't accept applications from clients with a criminal record (or where they're living with someone who has), unless the conviction is for a minor traffic offence, or is spent under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974.

## Cryptocurrency
We don't accept cryptocurrencies as a source of deposit.

## Client contact information
All new mortgage applications submitted must provide a personal email address and mobile number for each client. If your client is unable or unwilling to provide this information through the intermediary application process and they still wish to apply for a Santander mortgage, they’ll need to contact Santander directly by phone.

## Eligibility
At the time of application, your clients must:

## Execution only
We'll accept applications on an execution only basis for high net worth clients and Mortgage Professionals. For an application to be considered on an execution only basis your clients must meet the following criteria: Evidence of eligibility to proceed with execution only must be obtained from your client. We'll undertake regular monthly checks with a sample of intermediaries to check that they comply with the above criteria.

## Existing mortgage customers moving home
If your client already has a Santander mortgage, there are a couple of options available to them when they're moving home. Porting Porting is when an existing Santander mortgage customer moves home and transfers their mortgage product for the rest of its term. Most of our products are portable. It's possible to ‘port’ most existing products to a new mortgage as long as it's for house purchase/home ownership but not to a property being remortgaged or owned mortgage-free. Your client's right to port their mortgage product is always subject to the conditions for transferring the loan to a new mortgage in their Mortgage Terms and Conditions. In particular, any new mortgage application made will be subject to a full credit check and the customer/property must meet our lending criteria at the time of the new application. If we don't agree a new mortgage, your client won't be able to port their mortgage product and they may then need to pay an early repayment charge (ERC) if they then redeem their existing mortgage. Where redemption of the existing mortgage and purchase of the new property isn't simultaneous, as long as the purchase of the new property completes within 3 months of the redemption date, the existing product can be ported to the new mortgage. Any additional borrowing must come from the new business mortgage product range. Where your client is porting their existing mortgage to a new build property, they’ll receive a refund of the ERC in line with the criteria above, if the purchase of the new property completes within 6 months of the redemption date. Where your client chooses to port their Flexible Offset mortgage to a new property, the sale and purchase must be simultaneous. The 3 month ERC waiver window doesn't apply (because there's no ERC). Choosing a new product Existing Santander mortgage customers moving home can choose a new business product for their total borrowing. Where they’re currently tied in: You'll need to inform your client that they must tell their solicitor to deduct the full or partial percentage of ERC waiver from the redemption monies if redemption and completion are simultaneous. If completion is non-simultaneous, your client must pay the full ERC due on redemption. As long as completion of the new mortgage is within 3 months of redemption, your client can then request a refund of the full or partial ERC.

## First time buyer
A client who has never owned a property, whether in the UK or abroad. On joint applications all clients must meet the definition.

## Foreign nationals
We consider applications from non-UK/non-Irish nationals where the property is for their own use and for immediate occupation. These may be subject to full underwriting. We don't accept applications from foreign nationals holding diplomatic immunity. For applications where the LTV is over 75% and your client's income is required for affordability purposes, they must have the permanent right to reside in the UK e.g. indefinite leave to enter (ILE) or remain in the UK (ILR) or settled or pre-settled status (EEA/Swiss citizens). This must be supported by 1 of the following: Further information may be available from www.gov.uk/browse/visas-immigration/settle-in-the-uk

## Guarantors
We don't accept guarantor applications.

## Identification
A Confirmation of Verification of Identity Certificate must be completed and meet the requirements set out within the Joint Money Laundering Steering Group Guidance for the UK Financial Sector. We reserve the right to ask for additional client information, including identity evidence, where it's deemed necessary.

## Lending over 90% LTV
For lending over 90% LTV, your client will need to meet the following criteria: For LTV restrictions please refer to the 'Types and purpose of loans where we lend' section.

## Maximum age
We consider applications where the mortgage term doesn't exceed: Retired clients We treat clients as retired if they receive retirement income and aren’t reliant on income from employment or self-employment at the time of application. In these cases, there’s no intended retirement age. Subject to our maximum age policy at the end of the mortgage term, we can consider applications from retired clients. Existing Santander mortgage customers moving home: In all cases we undertake regular checks to assess the plausibility of your client's selected or anticipated age of retirement and we may request further information or evidence to support this.

## Porting
Please refer to the 'Existing mortgage customers moving home' section for more information.

## Property Investment Club
We don't accept applications where the property is being purchased by, from or connected to a Property Investment Club.

## Residency
All clients must: Exceptions to this policy are clients who meet 1 of the following scenarios:

## Self-employed
Where your client's shareholding in a company (or combined shareholding of all clients) is 20% or more, treat your client as self-employed. Where your client's shareholding in a company (or combined shareholding of all clients) is less than 20%, treat your client as employed. For family business employment, we require bank statements evidencing the latest 3 months' salary credits. We won't accept applications from clients who have been self-employed or owned their business for less than 2 years. Where accounts are marked with a negative 'going concern' qualification the application will be declined. We can consider income from alphabet share ownership for a director of a limited company. Please see our evidence requirements guide for more information.

## Solicitor panel
All mortgage applications are required to use a solicitor from the Santander panel. To find an appropriate local solicitor please use the solicitor search facility on our website.

## Voter's Roll (Electoral Register)
Clients who can't be traced on the voter's roll for the years they have lived at a property, may be considered subject to a letter from the local authority confirming they had registered for those years. For clients who didn't register at the address a written explanation should be obtained and submitted for consideration.
