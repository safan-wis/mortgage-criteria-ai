CCJs are generally taken into account in credit scoring however background details are required.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


### Background Mortgages (incl BTL) and Non-Simultaneous Sale expandable section

Simultaneous sale and purchase is the preferred route, but we recognise that this is not always possible.

Existing property is for sale but will not be sold before new mortgage completes - The existing mortgage payment must be keyed as a credit commitment and will be included in the affordability calculation.

Existing property to be rented out - The mortgage payment must be keyed as a credit commitment (the mortgage type for the commitment needs to by keyed as  Buy to Let'). The rent received should be keyed as 'Rental Income (if rental property)'.

Other Buy-to-Let mortgaged properties owned - The mortgages must be keyed as individual credit commitments and the total rent received keyed as 'Rental Income (if rental property).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


### Dependants expandable section

A dependant is anyone who is financially reliant on your customer, who is not a party to the mortgage and does not contribute to the mortgage payments. A dependant may be a child, spouse not party to the mortgage, adult or elderly relative or a future dependant.

You need to capture separately both Child and Adult Dependants.

Child Dependant

A child dependant would include any children for which the customer(s) is the primary carer and who is under 18. A child dependant would include a future dependant where the customer is expecting a baby or is in the process of adopting a child. Foster children should be included as dependants.

Where any children have income and can fully support themselves they do not need to be keyed as a dependant.

If a child is not living with the customer(s) and maintenance is being paid, a dependant does not need to be keyed, but the maintenance amount must be keyed as a commitment.

Adult Dependant

An adult dependant is someone who is not party to the mortgage but is financially reliant on the customer. This could be a spouse/partner, elderly relative or grown up children who are unemployed or in full time education.

Where the adult dependant resides at the property for some of the time, you would key this in the adult dependant field.

Alternatively, where the customer financially supports an adult dependant who doesn't reside at the property, they would not be keyed as a dependant, but the related costs instead must be keyed as a total figure in  Other Commitments .

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


### Deposit acceptance and documentation expandable section

All customers must make a minimum personal deposit for the property relevant to their individual credit score, product or scheme. No element of this deposit should be represented by a personal loan.

Where evidence of deposit is requested, the following documents are acceptable:

A genuine gift from a family member is acceptable as a source of deposit. If any of the deposit is gifted, this should be chosen as the source of deposit when keying the application.

The definition of a family member is someone who is related to at least one of the applicants as follows:

- Relative by birth/blood or by marriage/civil partnership:

- 'Common Law' partners or co-habitees.

- Partners or ex-partners who are not co-habiting at the property.

Gifts from the following are not acceptable:

When proof is required you should obtain a letter written by the family member that includes all of the following, or a Gifted Deposit template letter (PDF, 38KB) is available for you to use.

You should also provide a UK bank statement or UK passbook from the family member or applicants showing the deposit funds in their account. Alternatively, the family member or applicant may provide a letter from their UK bank confirming that the funds are available. Additional statements may be requested where required.

You should obtain:

Serving members of HM Forces may be able to raise capital for a deposit by means of a 'Forces Help to Buy' (FHTB) interest free loan which will be repaid by the customer through their pay.

This can be accepted as a deposit for a mortgage on a main residence or when using the Help to Buy Equity Loan scheme and the repayment must be keyed as a commitment.

FHTBs are repayable interest free over 10 years so to calculate the monthly payment, divide the amount borrowed under the FHTB scheme by 120.

Where the deposit is funded from FHTB, the deposit type should be keyed as savings. The applicant will not receive confirmation of the FHTB amount from HM Forces until they have received their mortgage offer, so there is no requirement to obtain evidence.

If the deposit is from equity (e.g. a reduced purchase price) the application should be treated as a concessionary purchase - refer to CONCESSIONARY PURCHASE FOR CRITERIA.

Vendor Gifted Deposits are an unacceptable source of deposit for any non new build property.

This does not impact buyers who are receiving gifted deposits to purchase New Build Properties or concessionary purchases.

• Husband/wife or civil partners.
• Parents, step-parents, parents-in-law.
• Brothers and sisters, half brothers and sisters, step-brothers and sisters, brother and sister-in-laws.
• Applicants' children, step-children, son and daughter in laws and adopted children.
• Grandparents, step-grandparents.
• Uncle/aunt (must be related by blood and not marriage).
• Nephew/niece.

• Friends, including family friends.
• Employers.
• Vendor, developer, landlord.
• Cousins.
• Foster/guardian children.

• Addressed to Halifax.
• Dated within the last three months.
• Name and address of the person(s) gifting the deposit.
• Name and address of the applicant(s).
• The relationship between the person(s) making the gift and the applicant(s). They must be a family member. See definition of family member above.
• The property address being purchased.
• The amount of the deposit being gifted.
• The source of the gifted deposit e.g. savings.
• The gift is  not repayable' and the person(s) gifting the deposit 'will hold no interest in the property following completion of the mortgage'.
• Signed by the person(s) gifting the deposit.

• The latest three months' UK bank statements or a UK passbook covering the latest three months' transactions showing the applicant's name, account details (sort code and account number for bank statements or account number for passbooks) and company name, or the latest annual statement for longer term savings plans
• The statements or passbook should be in the name of at least one of the applicants
• The latest closing balance must cover the total deposit required
• Any recent large or unusual deposit may require clarification to establish the source
• Where funds have originated from a business account, we may request confirmation from the accountant that the withdrawal will not have a negative impact on the business.


Savings

You should obtain:


Forces Help to Buy (previously called Long Service Advance of pay)

Serving members of HM Forces may be able to raise capital for a deposit by means of a 'Forces Help to Buy' (FHTB) interest free loan which will be repaid by the customer through their pay.
This can be accepted as a deposit for a mortgage on a main residence or when using the Help to Buy Equity Loan scheme and the repayment must be keyed as a commitment.
FHTBs are repayable interest free over 10 years so to calculate the monthly payment, divide the amount borrowed under the FHTB scheme by 120.
Where the deposit is funded from FHTB, the deposit type should be keyed as savings. The applicant will not receive confirmation of the FHTB amount from HM Forces until they have received their mortgage offer, so there is no requirement to obtain evidence.


Concessionary

If the deposit is from equity (e.g. a reduced purchase price) the application should be treated as a concessionary purchase - refer to CONCESSIONARY PURCHASE FOR CRITERIA.


Vendor Deposits and Cashbacks (Non New Build Properties)

Vendor Gifted Deposits are an unacceptable source of deposit for any non new build property.
This does not impact buyers who are receiving gifted deposits to purchase New Build Properties or concessionary purchases.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


### ExPats expandable section

We do not currently accept new business applications from ExPat residents.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


### Finders Fees expandable section

Applications involving finder's fees are not acceptable.

A finder's fee is a fee or commission paid by a seller to a third party (such as an investment club) for finding or introducing a buyer. It does not include the normal fee or commission payable to any estate agent handling the sale.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


### First Monthly Payment & Initial Interest expandable section

The first monthly payment is always collected in the month following completion, for example if a mortgage completes in June the first payment will be collected in July. This will be collected on the customer s chosen monthly payment date unless completion occurs in the last few days of any month and results in less than 4 working days between the completion date and the customer's chosen payment date (excluding those days), the first payment will then be collected on the 10th of that month. This date will then revert to the customer's chosen payment date on the following month.

The first monthly payment includes an amount of  Initial Interest  from the day of completion to the end of that month plus the first monthly mortgage payment. For example:

The 'Amount of each instalment' section of the mortgage illustration sets out a first payment assuming a mortgage completes on the 1st of the following month. A customer s first monthly payment may be different as it will depend on when the loan starts. We write to all customers when the mortgage starts to tell them when we will collect their first and subsequent payments.

• If completion occurs on the 15th, interest is calculated from the 15th to the end of the month and then added to the first payment
• If completion occurs on the 5th, interest is calculated from the 5th to the end of the month and then added to the first payment

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


### Interest Only expandable section

The maximum loan amount available on interest only is 75% loan to value (LTV) (or for sale of mortgaged property (SOMP) main residence 50%, 60% or 75% depending on the minimum equity requirement). On part interest only/part capital and interest repayment customers can borrow up to 85% LTV with the balance on capital and interest repayment.

Check the maximum loan on interest only for all repayment plans, including Sale of Mortgaged Property (SOMP) repayment plans, using the interest only calculator.

All loans arranged where the capital element is not included in the monthly payment, including those that are part capital and interest repayment, part interest only, must have a plan in place to repay the capital at the end of the term. This includes new loans, further advances and product transfers.

As a responsible lender, it is important for us to see evidence of the repayment plan for interest only mortgages so documents relating to the repayment plan must be received before a new mortgage offer can be considered.

The repayment plan must cover the whole amount of interest only. This information is only a guide. A mortgage offer will only be issued once we have confirmed that the evidence supplied meets our criteria.

Important points on repayment plans:

Only repayment vehicles for those customers intending to live at the mortgaged property may be used to support the loan. E.G. if a parent is named on the mortgage to help with affordability then a property in the parents name cannot be accepted as a repayment vehicle.

Existing Halifax mortgage customers moving home

If an existing customer does not meet the current interest only rules we may consider allowing interest only on the new mortgage up to the level held currently, provided the mortgage term is not increasing. Please refer to your BDM for guidance.

• Sole applicant with an income of  75,000 or more
• Joint applicants where one applicant has an income of  75,000 or more, or where the combined income of both applicants is  100,000 or more. e.g. this could be  60k and  40k, therefore no applicant has an income of  75,000 or more but together their income is  100,000 or more
• The income requirement is calculated on the total of Basic, Overtime, Bonus and Commission for employed applicants or the latest year's income for self-employed customers.

• An annual bonus figure is calculated from the payslips provided as evidence
• Where bonus is paid annually the average of the bonus received in the last 2 years is used
• 30% of this bonus figure is then multiplied by the term of the mortgage required for the amount of Interest Only lending available
• There is an expectation that the customer will make periodic lump sum repayments to reduce the amount outstanding during their Interest Only mortgage and it is important the customer understands this, however Early Repayment Charges would apply as normal where any overpayment concession is exceeded
• Where any Bonus is to be used as a repayment plan no bonus income earned by any customer will be used in the affordability assessment
• Lending Into Retirement - the term of any Interest Only lending must not exceed the lower of the Anticipated Retirement Age or Maximum Working Age of 70 where Bonus is being used as a Repayment Plan. The term can run up to 364 days past the lower of the ARA / MWA of 70.

• If received monthly the latest 3 payslips. If received quarterly, the latest 4 bonus payslips

• Sole applicant with an income of  75,000 or more
• Joint applicants where one applicant has an income of  75,000 or more, or where the combined income of both applicants is  100,000 or more. e.g. this could be  60k and  40k, therefore no applicant has an income of  75,000 or more but together their income is  100,000 or more

• If a minimum  50,000 has been held in a savings or current account (  sterling) for a minimum 3 consecutive months 100% of the current cash balance can be used to support Interest Only lending
• If the statements show a fluctuating cash balance then the lowest balance will be used
• If savings are also being used as source of deposit then evidence of an amount sufficient for both the repayment plan and deposit must be provided
• Lending Into Retirement   the term of any Interest Only lending must not exceed the Maximum Working Age of 70 where Cash is being used as a Repayment Plan.

• Sole or joint applicants have a combined income of  50,000 or more
• The income requirement is calculated on the total of Basic, Overtime, Bonus and Commission for employed applicants or the latest year's income for self-employed customers.

• Copy of latest projection statement dated within last 12 months
• Endowment companies will present three growth rates to a customer with the middle one (for example 6%) being the most likely projected outcome. We allow up to 100% of projected amount using the middle % figure.

• Sole or joint applicants have a combined income of  50,000 or more
• The income requirement is calculated on the total of Basic, Overtime, Bonus and Commission for employed applicants or the latest year's income for self-employed customers.

• Copy of latest pension statement dated within the last 12 months
• The pension must have a minimum projected total fund value of  400,000 of which a maximum 15% of this amount will be used to support Interest Only lending
• Where a projected total fund value does not show on the pension statement e.g. on a final salary pension if the projected lump sum is at least  100,000 up to 60% of a projected lump sum value can be used
• Where a statement gives a range of projected values the middle of three figures or the lower of two would be used
• Pensions belonging to the same person can be combined to reach the  400,000 or  100,000 levels but pensions held by joint applicants cannot be combined to meet these levels
• Pension contributions should be collected under  Total monthly payment towards Investment Vehicles' and will be used within affordability calculations
• It is important the customer understands the need to maintain the pension contributions
• Lending Into Retirement - the term of any Interest Only lending must not exceed the lower of the Anticipated Retirement Age or Maximum Working Age of 70 where Pension is being used as a Repayment Plan. The term can run up to 364 days past the lower of the ARA / MWA of 70.

• Joint applicants where one applicant has an income of  75,000 or more, or where the combined income of both applicants is  100,000 or more. e.g. this could be  60k and  40k, therefore no applicant has an income of  75,000 or more but together their income is  100,000 or more
• The income requirement is calculated on the total of Basic, Overtime, Bonus and Commission for employed applicants or the latest year's income for self-employed customers

• The equity amount available in the property being mortgaged can be used to support Interest Only lending
• This will be calculated using the valuation/property assessment carried out as part of the application and any existing or new additional borrowing elsewhere to be secured against the property must be declared and will reduce the equity amount available
• If the property is to be a main residence there must be a minimum equity amount available. The equity amount is calculated as the property value minus interest only amount:
• Up to 50% interest only the minimum equity requirement will be  300,000
• For >50%-60% the minimum equity will be  500,000
• For >60%-75% the minimum equity will be  750,000
• For part Interest Only / part capital and interest repayment lending the minimum equity will be calculated at the end of the mortgage term, not at point of application.
• The maximum Loan To Value (LTV) on Interest Only is 75%; part interest only / part capital and interest repayment is available with the balance above the SOMP interest only amount, up to a maximum 85% LTV, on a capital and interest repayment basis.
• The term on any Capital & Interest Repayment element cannot exceed the term on Interest Only
• If the property is on the  second home' scheme the minimum equity requirement does not apply and a maximum LTV of 75% can be on Interest Only
• It is important the customer understands the requirement to sell their property at the end of the term to repay the Interest Only loan amount
• Lending Into Retirement   the term of any Interest Only lending must not exceed the Maximum Working Age of 70 where Sale of Mortgage Property is being used as a Repayment Plan (except where property is  second home' where a longer term may be considered).

• Due to valuation and verification requirements this is restricted to properties within the UK
• Completed interest only - other residential property form and, if the mortgage lender is outside Lloyds Banking Group, a copy of the latest mortgage statement dated within last 12 months
• We will check the ownership of the other residential property and assess its value using an automated valuation (AVM). (Ownership of the other residential property must be in the same name as the applicants)
• We will compare the equity available in the property with the amount of interest only lending required
• Current equity within the property must be over  50,000
• We will use 80% of the current equity value of the property to support interest only lending
• If the valuation fails to sufficiently value the other property the customer could obtain a full valuation of the property (at their own cost) using a RICS certified surveyor
• Please note that there is a minimum greater than  50,000 equity requirement for each individual property being used to support Interest Only lending
• If the property is not already purchased, evidence required will also include; property details, Acting Solicitor to confirm intended ownership of the second property, details of any loans to be secured against this property (property valuation and land registry search carried out by us if needed). We will confirm the intended ownership of the second property prior to offer on the new mortgage / further advance.

• Sole or joint applicants have a combined income of  50,000 or more
• The income requirement is calculated on the total of Basic, Overtime, Bonus and Commission for employed applicants or the latest year's income for self-employed customers.

• We are not providing advice on your customer's repayment plan(s) or making any guarantee that their plan(s) will be sufficient to repay the outstanding balance (capital) at the end of the mortgage term.
• Your customer should review their plan(s) regularly during the term of their mortgage to make sure it is on track to repay the outstanding balance.
• Periodically, we will ask your customer to provide evidence of their repayment plan(s). If your customer is unable to satisfy us that their repayment plan(s) remains on track to repay the outstanding balance on their mortgage, we may ask your customer to transfer some or all of their mortgage onto a capital and interest repayment basis.
• Please remember it is your customer's responsibility to ensure they have sufficient funds to repay their outstanding balance at the end of the mortgage term. If they are unable to do so, their home may be repossessed to repay the outstanding balance.

• Repayment plans CANNOT be accepted if they include the name of anyone NOT named on the mortgage.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


### Lending into retirement expandable section

The maximum age at the end of the mortgage term is 80 years for all lending.

Future retirement income will need to be verified where the customer is taking a mortgage term which extends beyond the earlier of their anticipated retirement age or a maximum working age, for which we will use 70 or 75. Affordability will be assessed on the future retirement income. On occasions, a further review will be required to confirm we feel it is appropriate for the customer to lend into retirement.

The applicant's plans should be discussed in view of their occupation, and reasonability of working beyond state pension age should be documented where appropriate.

We will require a  Customer Working Age form  (PDF, 3.14MB) to be completed by all customers on an application where the mortgage term passes a working age of 70 for any customer. This form asks the customer(s) to confirm they have considered the implications of the term chosen and that they believe they can continue to work until the age indicated. The completed form will be required before we can proceed to offer. Please see also Maximum Working Age.

The types of evidence which can be used to verify anticipated retirement income are as follows:

The types of evidence which can be used to verify Pension Income already being received are as follows:

For State Pension, War Pension and Widows Pension

For Company or Private Pension

• Private / Company Pension Forecast Statement dated within the last 18 months
• State Pension Statement dated within last 18 months which must be obtained by the customer directly as an actual statement with their name and address on it (this can be obtained from The Pension Service).
• State Pension Forecast statement issued to the customer directly from The Pension Service with their name and address on it.

• We do not lend using any income provided by lodger(s)
• If a lodger(s) have exclusive occupation of a self-contained part of the house (e.g. an annex) or your customer does not intend to occupy the property on a permanent basis, this will require further checks as the lodger(s) may acquire legal rights

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


### Max Term expandable section

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


### Min/Max Age expandable section

• Please see also Maximum Working Age
• The maximum age at the end of the mortgage term is 80 years for all repayment mortgages and 70 if any part of the mortgage is on an interest only basis.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


### Non UK Nationals expandable section

Applications can be considered for non-UK nationals up to 95% loan to value (LTV):

If a next step message shows  Proof of permanent right to reside in the UK is required for at least one applicant  we can proceed with proof that the customer (or any customer on a joint application) has permanent right to reside, OR proof that the customer (or any customer on a joint application) has lived in the UK for more than 5 years. Otherwise the loan to value would have to be reduced to 75% LTV to proceed.

As part of the EU Settlement Scheme EEA, EU and Swiss citizens, living in the UK by 31 December 2020 can apply to continue to live in the UK after 30 June 2021 and will receive one of two statuses which are both acceptable:

When an application has one customer who has lived in the UK for more than 5 years, or meets the minimum income requirement above, or is a maximum 75% LTV then there is no requirement for the customer(s) to hold a particular type of visa or to have a minimum remaining visa validity.

 Lived in the UK for more than 5 years   means lived in the UK for at least the latest 5 years, but the customer may have spent period(s) aboard within the last 5 years. We will use data provided by the credit reference agencies to determine if a customer has lived in the UK for more than 5 years. Alternatively we can accept proof from the customer e.g. a bank statement, HMRC tax notification, Local Authority Tax Bill or utility bill dated over 5 years ago.

To calculate the income of  75,000 or  100,000 we will include the total of all earned incomes or the latest year s income for self employed customers.

On Shared Equity and Shared Ownership schemes, to determine if the <=75% loan to value (LTV) criteria has been met, the percentage LTV is calculated as the loan amount against the value of the customer's equity share. (On Shared Equity applications this differs to the LTV used for selecting from the product range which is the loan amount against the total purchase price).

Applications from non-UK nationals holding diplomatic immunity are not acceptable.

• Settled status (awarded where they have lived in UK for at least 5 years and also known as 'indefinite leave to remain under the EU Settlement Scheme').
• Pre-settled status (awarded where lived in the UK for less than 5 years and they can re apply for settled status after 5 years continuous residence in UK has been reached).
• Indefinite leave to enter or remain.
• Republic of Ireland citizens do not need to apply under the EU Settlement Scheme and have automatic permanent right to reside in the UK (no proof of permanent right to reside is required for ROI citizens).

• An immigration status 'share code' - customers who can view their immigration status online at gov.uk can provide a share code which lasts for 30 days and we can use to view their immigration status e.g. settled or pre-settled status.
• Please note only  immigration status  share codes starting with an  S  are acceptable and not  right to work  or  right to rent  share codes.
• Indefinite leave stamp in passport including: Indefinite Right (or Leave) to Remain/Enter; Right of Abode; 'There is at present no time limit on the holder's stay in the United Kingdom .
• Biometric Residence Permit showing 'indefinite' rights to remain (this includes 'indefinite leave to remain', 'indefinite leave to enter' or 'no time limit ).
• Letter from the Home Office confirming indefinite right to remain in the UK.


Permanent right to reside can include:

As part of the EU Settlement Scheme EEA, EU and Swiss citizens, living in the UK by 31 December 2020 can apply to continue to live in the UK after 30 June 2021 and will receive one of two statuses which are both acceptable:


Proof of permanent right to reside could be verified to one of the following:

When an application has one customer who has lived in the UK for more than 5 years, or meets the minimum income requirement above, or is a maximum 75% LTV then there is no requirement for the customer(s) to hold a particular type of visa or to have a minimum remaining visa validity.
 Lived in the UK for more than 5 years   means lived in the UK for at least the latest 5 years, but the customer may have spent period(s) aboard within the last 5 years. We will use data provided by the credit reference agencies to determine if a customer has lived in the UK for more than 5 years. Alternatively we can accept proof from the customer e.g. a bank statement, HMRC tax notification, Local Authority Tax Bill or utility bill dated over 5 years ago.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


### Max No of Applicants expandable section

• Maximum of four applicants
• Two incomes are taken into account for affordability.
• For Bonus/Cash/Sale Of Mortgage Property repayment plans, only the income from the first two applicants will be used to determine the income qualifying criteria.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


### Sub Sales & Back to Back transactions expandable section

Sub-sales and back-to-back transactions are not acceptable.

A sub-sale occurs when a property is bought and then sold on within six months, i.e. the borrower is buying the property from someone who has themselves bought the property less than six months before. The date of registration at the Land Registry is how we determine the length of ownership.

This means that the current vendor must have owned the property for at least six months before we can accept an application to purchase that property.

A back-to-back transaction is a type of sub-sale where the intervening seller buys from the original seller and sells on to the borrower on the same day or within a few days. We also regard as sub-sales, cases where the seller acquires the freehold (or superior leasehold) title to the property, which they then immediately sell on to the borrower by the grant to them of a lease (or sub-lease).

The following cases are exceptions where it is acceptable for the property to be sold on within six months of acquisition by the seller.

Where sales are by:

We will also accept inherited properties where the applicant is a beneficiary but has not owned the property for 6 months. Applications where the applicant is not a beneficiary of the inherited property and the beneficiary has owned the property for less than 6 months are not acceptable and must be declined. The conveyancer will be responsible for ensuring the application meets the acceptable criteria.

Applications which involve assignable contracts or irrevocable powers of attorney in favour of intervening sellers are not acceptable. Any other structure to the transaction which has a similar effect should be reported to us.

• A personal representative of the registered proprietor; or
• An institutional mortgagee exercising its power of sale; or
• A receiver, trustee-in-bankruptcy or liquidator; or
• A developer or builder selling a property acquired under a part-exchange scheme.
• A registered Housing Provider (Housing Association) exercising a power of sale.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


### Affordability, LTI and Income Multiples expandable section

Halifax use affordability as a way of assessing how much they will lend. Where the loan requested is above the maximum loan available from our affordability calculation the loan amount should be reduced to proceed or the application will be declined. Please refer to our affordability calculator.

PLEASE NOTE: The affordability calculator will give a guide to the amount we would be willing to lend however, as no credit search is carried out please be aware that this amount is subject to change once the Decision in Principle (DIP) is keyed.

When calculating affordability, the following Loan to Income (LTI) caps also apply. These can be used to calculate the maximum loan that would be available based on income but these are caps and the actual maximum loan could be lower and can be impacted by loan to value and credit score.

First time buyer Boost LTI eligibility

Please note:

A property s Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) rating is used in our affordability calculations allowing us to reflect a more tailored view of energy costs. A customer whose property has a higher EPC rating (e.g. A/B) will generally have lower energy costs than those with a lower EPC rating (F/G) on like-for-like use.

For properties with an A/B EPC rating you may see a small increase in the maximum loan amount available and for properties with an F/G EPC rating a small decrease. There is no change to the maximum loan available for properties with a C, D or E EPC rating or where the EPC is unknown.

For some customers we may make a deduction within our affordability calculation to allow for financial planning commitments the customer may have going forward.

Within our affordability calculation we may apply an affordability adjustment for some contractors to take into account likely business expenses.

In some circumstances we may deduct credit commitments as ongoing in our affordability calculation even when customers have declared an intention to repay these. If the maximum loan available is reduced as a result then the loan amount must be reduced to proceed.

When calculating affordability on interest only loans, Halifax will take into account the monthly premiums payable for the relevant repayment vehicle i.e. existing endowment or new or existing ISA. Please ensure the premium(s) is specified at both DIP and full application.

Affordability must also include future changes to income and expenditure.

Where the maximum loan available is below that requested there may be the option to extend the term (up to retirement) or extend term into retirement (subject to evidence of adequate retirement income).

Please note, if the maximum loan available is reduced due to income not being evidenced at the declared level then the loan amount must be reduced accordingly.

Only in the below scenarios may we consider a loan amount above the maximum loan from our affordability model:

For Mortgage Prisoners criteria, please refer to our Mortgage Prisoners section.

• Purchase applications only.
• Any applicant is a first-time buyer (could be one applicant on a joint application, key FTB as first applicant).
• Total income on application is  50,000 or more.
• Loan to value (LTV) is 90% or less.
• Not available on shared equity or shared ownership schemes.
• For applications with any element of self-employed income please refer to the standard LTI table.
• For a small number of applications the overall credit profile may restrict the LTI applied to 5.00x rather than 5.50x shown, or the level of credit score may mean standard LTIs will apply.

• If the loan is for an Affordable Housing scheme (Shared Equity or Shared Ownership) then a scheme max LTI of 4.49x would apply.
• If there is any element of self-employed income on an application and the application income is up to  75k, a maximum LTI of 4.49x will apply. For loans where the application income > 75k, and there is any element of self employed income, the normal 5.50x maximum LTI applies up to 75% LTV. For loans > 500,000 to  750,000 of 85.01% to 95% LTV and for loans > 750,000 to  1m of 75.01% to 85% LTV a 4.00x LTI will apply.
• For like for like remortgage customers with no additional borrowing, who receive employed income only, up to 75% loan to value (LTV) and subject to credit score a 5.50x LTI will apply where the standard LTI would normally be below this level. A maximum LTI of 4.49x will still apply for remortgages on an Affordable Housing scheme (Shared Equity or Shared Ownership).
• The level of credit score achieved and overall credit profile may restrict the LTI applied; this may be restricted to 4.49x, to 5.00x rather than 5.50x shown and if income > 75k and loan > 500k where 4.49x shows this may be restricted to 4.00x.
• A different maximum LTI may sometimes apply as a result of the particular product selected.

• Existing Halifax mortgage customers with no increase in in loan amount or loan to value (LTV) compared with their current mortgage (see Existing Customers).
• There is additional income, not previously considered, that is expected for the life of the mortgage and can be evidenced in line with our requirements.

For Shared Ownership/Shared Equity schemes the rental/interest payments are collected within the  Scheme  details screen and should not be keyed as Commitments.

We will use assumed values for the following within our affordability assessment which means the following do not need to be keyed as commitments:

If a customer does advise they are paying more for any of these commitments than an average customer would, then you should key these in as a commitment under  other .

• It is very important that all commitments are keyed accurately so we can make an accurate affordability assessment. Please ensure you are familiar with the full list of commitment types that need to be keyed and how different commitments are treated, as shown in the table below
• You should have a thorough conversation with the customer around all their commitments/outgoings and it is recommended that you ask the customer to provide a copy of their credit report from the credit reference agencies to ensure all commitments are included
• Only if there are no commitments should  None  be selected from the system dropdown list
• Please include any additional commitments that have been applied as a credit entry with credit reference agencies/bureaus e.g. mobile phone contracts

• Commitments to be repaid on or before completion must still be keyed and you should select  Yes  for  Intend to Repay on Completion . This includes the existing mortgage on a remortgage application
• Commitments should only be marked as to be repaid where the customer advises it is their definite intention to repay these by completion, this appears plausible given the amount of the payments required and remaining term of the commitment, and you are satisfied they have adequate means to repay these commitments e.g. from available savings or regular income
• Where commitments are keyed as to be repaid a special condition on the mortgage offer will state the mortgage has been assessed on the basis of the declared intention to repay these commitments and it is the customer responsibility to ensure that these commitments are repaid. Completion takes place on the condition that such repayment takes place
• If any commitments were recently repaid but may still be shown on credit reference agencies/bureau information these commitments should be keyed and marked as  Yes  for  Intend to Repay on Completion 
• If repaying part of an outstanding commitment, then it must be split and keyed as two commitments: one to be repaid and one to remain
• For all loans above 85% loan to value (LTV)   and for any other applications where we decide that it is prudent   we will deduct commitments as ongoing even where the customer has declared an intention to repay these at or before completion. The loan amount must be affordable with these commitments deducted as remaining

• Please check if a customer s payslips show any deductions that should be keyed as commitments e.g. student loans, child care vouchers or salary sacrifice loan schemes (e.g. cars)

• Where keying commitments with no definitive  End Date  key a likely end date
• For commitments with a monthly payment and no total outstanding balance key the balance as an annual commitment i.e. 12 x monthly payment
• Financial dependants - please see our Dependants section for the definition of child and adult dependants
• Adverse credit history - please see Adverse Credit for guidance on how to answer these application questions

• Include any car lease or Personal Contract Purchase (PCPs)

• Include any secured or unsecured loans
• Include as a loan any monthly payment to a Debt Management Plan/IVA

• Include any deferred payment credit (DPC) e.g. pay in 3 or 4 payments as well as longer term buy now pay later options
• If the customer is still in the payment free period key what the monthly payment will be once these commence

• Include any retailer loans e.g. furniture

• If a customer advises that they have not yet started making any payments this does not need to be included, but if they are or are about to start payments, then this should be keyed
• Please check if a customer s payslips show a student loan is being repaid and should be keyed as a commitment
• When a student loan commitment is keyed it will be deducted in our affordability calculation, even if it is selected as being repaid upon completion

• Key the current outstanding balance and monthly payment being made by the customer
• 5% of the outstanding balance is taken as a monthly commitment even if the customer declares that they are currently making a lower payment
• If your customer clears their balance in full each month, key the monthly payment to be the same as the outstanding balance and select  No  for  Intend to Repay on Completion 
• Include any store cards

• (See under Credit card)

• Key the current outstanding balance and monthly payment being made by the customer
• 5% of the outstanding balance is taken as a monthly commitment even if the customer declares that they are currently making a lower payment
• If your customer clears their balance in full each month, key the monthly payment to be the same as the outstanding balance and select  No  for  Intend to Repay on Completion 

• Key the monthly payment and balance as confirmed by the customer

• Include any nursery costs, childminder costs, child care vouchers and before/after school clubs
• Please check if a customer s payslips show child care vouchers which should be keyed as a commitment

• Include any payments for an ex-partner or dependent children who are not living with the customer

• Key the monthly fees amount as confirmed by the customer

• On Remortgages the existing mortgage to be replaced with our mortgage must be keyed as a commitment with  Yes  for  Intend to Repay ; under source of funds select other and type  this mortgage 
• A mortgage  type  must be completed for any mortgage commitment which will usually be either  Residential , or  Buy to Let  if the property is already let or is to be let
• For any Buy to Let (BTL) mortgages please also key the rental income received under  Other income  in the customer s income section. If the gross rental income received is below 125% of the BTL mortgage payments the shortfall will automatically be deducted as a commitment in our affordability assessment
• If an existing residential mortgage is being remortgaged/converted to a BTL then key a residential mortgage as being repaid and a new BTL mortgage commitment as to remain with the new balance/payment that will apply upon completion
• For any other  residential  mortgaged properties to remain in the background an assumed running cost will be deducted within the affordability assessment

• If purchasing a leasehold property you must tick  Yes  to  Do you intend to purchase a flat? 
• Under Commitment type you will then be able to key the service charge and/or ground rent amounts
• Key  1 if no fee applies
• At Decision in Principle stage if the commitments have not been keyed, as not known, we will use an assumed value for these in our affordability calculation, which may mean that at Full Application when the true details are keyed under the property details page, this could affect the loan amount we are willing to lend
• When a full application is keyed and the service charge/ground rent keyed under the property details, we will use the higher of the value from the commitments screen or property details screen, so there is no need to amend/delete the details keyed under the credit commitments as they will not be counted twice

• (See under Ground rent)

• Should be selected if an unencumbered residential property will remain in the background
• Key  1 as running cost and a standard deduction for these costs will be included in our affordability calculation

• If the customer has any rental agreements in their name for another property which will continue e.g. a pied-e-terre

• For any other regular committed expenditure which the customer could not, or would not want to stop, and it doesn t fit into any category
• Anything keyed as  other  will be deducted in our affordability calculation, even if it is selected as being repaid on completion

### Contractors expandable section

Where a customer's income comes from a contract and they are not employed on a permanent basis they are classed as a contractor. This will include individuals who are self-employed and pay their own tax, those who are employed via an umbrella company who deduct their tax and people who are essentially employed but on a fixed/short term contract e.g. 12 months.

Contractors can be treated as self-employed or employed for income verification purposes:

Treat as Self Employed if:

Income is confirmed as standard for self-employed customers.

Treat as Employed if:

Additionally to be treated as employed the customer must have either:

When we are treating a contractor as employed for income verification these are our requirements:

Applications from customers employed on a Construction Industry Scheme (CIS) Contract will be considered. Income should be evidenced using the latest 3 months consecutive payslips/invoices/statement along with corresponding bank statements (this could be from the same or different contracts).

For example, if income in January, February and March is used, payslips/invoices/statement and corresponding bank statements must be for January, February and March. An average of the latest 3 months income should be used. This average amount should then be calculated based on a 46 week year e.g. multiply the average monthly pay x 12, divide by 52 weeks and multiply by 46.

If no income is received or the customer is unable to provide both pieces of evidence of income, then  zero' income must be used for that month.

Customers should be treated as self-employed if they pay their own tax or sub contract to more than one company.

Applications from customers employed on a zero hours contract for over 12 months will be considered. Proof of all income in the last 12 months is required and that total income figure will be used.

Income from probationary employment is only used where the probationary period is part of a permanent contract. If the contract is purely probationary with the employer having the option to terminate the contract then this income cannot be used.

It is important that probationary contracts are keyed accurately as follows:

Where the applicant receives an offer of permanent employment and the contract states an initial probationary period e.g. three or six months, it should be keyed as 'permanent'. The income will be used in the affordability assessment.

Where the applicant is offered a probationary contract, e.g. for three months, at the end of which the employer has the option to determine if a permanent contract will be offered, it should be keyed as  probationary'. The income will not be used in the affordability assessment.

Applications will be considered from Professional Sports People where either continuous employment of 12 months or more with 6 months of the contract remaining or 2 years continuous service (for the last two years as at the date of application) in the same type of employment can be confirmed. It is essential to establish that such individuals will have the ability to sustainably meet the monthly repayments as they near the end of their career or if their career should be ended abruptly due to injury.

• The customer pays their own tax, OR
• Has more than 1 contract, OR
• Has set up a limited company and employs other contractors.

• Tax is paid by the company they work for (or they are employed via an umbrella company who deduct tax) OR
• Contractors who earn more than  500 per day or  75k per annum, OR are an IT contractor on any income, can be treated as employed irrespective if the customer pays their own tax, or classes themselves as self-employed. (The only exception to this is where a customer has more than one contract or they have set up a limited company and employs other contractors, in which case they should be treated as self-employed).

• 12 months or more continuous employment, with 6 months of the contract remaining, or
• 2 years continuous service (for the last 2 years as at the date of application) in the same type of employment

• Copy of latest contract and latest month s payslip(s) required (or where payslips not issued latest month s bank statement).
• Income to be used is the lower of the gross value of the contract or income calculated from payslip(s)/bank statement.
• Gross value of contract is calculated as daily rate on the contract x 5 days per week x 46 weeks per year (or hourly rate x 7 hours per day x 5 days per week x 46 weeks per year). Unless the contract states the actual hours/days worked are lower in which case use these figures.
• Income from payslip(s)/bank statement is calculated by multiplying the gross pay received to give an annual figure and then calculating the income based on a 46 week year (unless the contract states the actual weeks to be worked is lower in which case use these figures) e.g. multiply gross pay on a monthly payslip x 12, divide by 52 weeks and multiply by 46 (or average the gross pay on the weekly payslips and x 46).
• The total gross pay showing on umbrella payslips may be broken down by basic salary, commission,  additional taxable income', holiday pay etc. but as long as the contract confirms the contractor is paid via a daily rate, or hourly rate, the income does not need to be split into these separate elements and can all be keyed as basic salary.
• The lower of the two figures calculated is keyed as income and used for affordability.
• For customers who have set up a Limited Company or a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) the income evidence must be from the actual contracted employer not their own Limited Company.
• Contractors who are set up as a Limited Company may not be entitled to the full income of the contract where there is more than one shareholder. If there are other shareholders, and they are also to be named on the mortgage the income from the contract must be keyed for one customer only and no income from this contract can be keyed for the other applicants that are shareholders. If there are other shareholders, but they are not to be named on the mortgage the income should be keyed to reflect the customer share e.g. if 50% share then 50% of income should be used.

• The latest month s payslip(s) must be used to evidence income, or latest 3 months  payslips where other income is being used.
• Income from payslip is calculated by multiplying the gross pay received to give an annual figure and then calculating the income based on a 46 week year e.g. multiply gross pay on a monthly payslip x 12, divide by 52 weeks and multiply by 46 (or average the gross pay on the weekly payslips and x 46).


Self Employed

Treat as Self Employed if:
Income is confirmed as standard for self-employed customers.


Employed

Treat as Employed if:
Additionally to be treated as employed the customer must have either:
When we are treating a contractor as employed for income verification these are our requirements:


Contractor who pays own tax, or it is deducted by umbrella company (including IR35)


Fixed/Short Term or Agency; tax is deducted by employer (not including IR35)


Construction Industry Scheme Contractors (CIS)

Applications from customers employed on a Construction Industry Scheme (CIS) Contract will be considered. Income should be evidenced using the latest 3 months consecutive payslips/invoices/statement along with corresponding bank statements (this could be from the same or different contracts).
For example, if income in January, February and March is used, payslips/invoices/statement and corresponding bank statements must be for January, February and March. An average of the latest 3 months income should be used. This average amount should then be calculated based on a 46 week year e.g. multiply the average monthly pay x 12, divide by 52 weeks and multiply by 46.
If no income is received or the customer is unable to provide both pieces of evidence of income, then  zero' income must be used for that month.
Customers should be treated as self-employed if they pay their own tax or sub contract to more than one company.


Zero hours contracts

Applications from customers employed on a zero hours contract for over 12 months will be considered. Proof of all income in the last 12 months is required and that total income figure will be used.


Probation

Income from probationary employment is only used where the probationary period is part of a permanent contract. If the contract is purely probationary with the employer having the option to terminate the contract then this income cannot be used.
It is important that probationary contracts are keyed accurately as follows:
Where the applicant receives an offer of permanent employment and the contract states an initial probationary period e.g. three or six months, it should be keyed as 'permanent'. The income will be used in the affordability assessment.
Where the applicant is offered a probationary contract, e.g. for three months, at the end of which the employer has the option to determine if a permanent contract will be offered, it should be keyed as  probationary'. The income will not be used in the affordability assessment.


Professional Sports People

Applications will be considered from Professional Sports People where either continuous employment of 12 months or more with 6 months of the contract remaining or 2 years continuous service (for the last two years as at the date of application) in the same type of employment can be confirmed. It is essential to establish that such individuals will have the ability to sustainably meet the monthly repayments as they near the end of their career or if their career should be ended abruptly due to injury.

### Non-Sterling income (Foreign income) expandable section

Non-sterling income can be accepted on purchase, remortgage, further advance (FA) and product transfer (PT) applications where a full affordability assessment is required. There is no minimum income level for non-sterling income to be used. For FAs/PTs non-sterling income can be used even if this was not included on the original purchase/remortgage application.

We will accept income in the following five non-sterling currencies: US Dollar, Euro, Australian Dollar, Indian Rupee and Swiss Franc.

The income types we ll accept in non-sterling are employed basic salary, bonus, overtime and commission. Non-Sterling income cannot be accepted for  other income  types. The only self-employed income acceptable in non-sterling is a partner of an LLP (Limited Liability Partnership) where the income can be keyed as self-employed and is verified to a letter from a finance director.

We can include sterling income and non-sterling income on the same application, but we can only use one non-sterling currency on an application.

Our website Mortgage affordability calculator will collect non-sterling incomes. This calculation is based on current exchange rates so when an application is made they may receive a different rate. When a Decision in Principle (DIP) is keyed the exchange rate to be used on that application will not then change, so the maximum loan available would not change due to any currency fluctuations.

On our income screens you ll see a new currency dropdown field and should key in the amount in the originating non-sterling currency, not the equivalent GBP amount. We ll convert the income amount to GBP and apply a haircut of 20% (10% for bonus income) to cover any potential currency fluctuations.

For income verification if payslips show the amount in the originating currency that is sufficient, but if they only show the converted GBP figure you should upload a compensation letter/remuneration statement in addition to the payslip(s). This document should show the income amount in the original currency which is what we will require.

The compensation letter/remuneration statement can be a document that was sent directly to the customer by their employer, or received online but should show:

Payslips and any other documents must be in English language.

All mortgage applicants must be UK residents which means they must have a  primary address  in the UK. If someone s primary address is outside the UK and they only have a correspondence address in the UK they are not a UK resident and a correspondence or family member s address must not be declared as a primary address. A primary address does not need to be the address where someone spends the majority, or even a certain proportion, of their time e.g. they could spend the majority of their time at a foreign address due to working abroad but still have their primary address in the UK. This is not the same as  tax residency  and we do not require customers meet any tax resident requirements.

Non-sterling income is any income other than sterling received by a customer; non-sterling income converted to GBP to be paid into a UK bank account is still considered to be non-sterling income. Channel Islands/Crown Dependencies i.e. Jersey, Guernsey and Isle of Man plus Gibraltar and Falkland Islands should be treated as GBP and not non-sterling. Please note the amount of any  haircuts  are subject to change.

When non-sterling income is used two additional paragraphs will show on the Mortgage Illustration in the  Main features of loan  and  Amount of each instalment  sections. A letter will be sent to the customer after completion if the exchange rate goes down by more than 20% to advise them and confirm the support available if required.

Q   Can you accept a contractor with a contract in a non-sterling currency?

A   Yes, standard contractor income verification requirements would apply; a copy of the contract would be required together with bank statements or payslips to show the actual income being received. If bank statements only show the converted GBP amount received then to consider the application payslips or a compensation letter/remuneration statement would need to be available to show the amount received in the non-sterling currency

Q   What is the treatment for seafarer contractors?

A   The seafarers employment type refers to people who may work in various different roles on a seagoing vessel e.g. on a cruise ship or oil rig. Seafarers can be permanently employed but are most commonly contractors who are responsible for paying their own tax (which includes people who may say they are  tax exempt ) and for seafarer contractors the following treatment should be followed:

Q   Can you accept a self-employed customer where the business receives some income from overseas?

A   If a company is not UK based we could not use self-employed income as we would be unable to evidence this income per our standard self-employed verification requirements. If a company is UK based we will use sterling income as evidenced on tax calculations (SA302s) and tax year overviews as normal ; if a  Foreign income  amount is shown on the SA302 this amount should not be included in the income keyed

Q   How do I key a bonus received in different currencies in each of the last 2 years e.g. previous year bonus in US$ and latest year in GBP?

A   Only the latest year s bonus could be used. The currency selected would be the currency of the latest year s bonus. A two year average would be calculated using the latest year s bonus amount and zero bonus for the previous year

Q   Do customers need to be paid into a UK bank account?

A   No, there is no specific requirement that income is paid into a UK bank account. All applicants must be UK residents as normal

Q   Do payslips need to show UK tax being deducted?

A   No, there is no requirement for payslips to show UK tax being deducted, and they could show no tax or foreign tax being deducted. All applicants must be UK residents as normal

• Payslips must show the applicant and employer name, pay date, basic income, gross & net pay and any additional payments being used in affordability
• We will require contact details for the employer so we can request the reference directly from them and this must be returned directly to us.
• We will provide a form the employer can complete and return with their company headed paper, or they can provide a response in their own format as long as all the requested information is included: employer name and address; the employee s name; employee's start date, contract status and income details (basic salary and any other income elements). The reference must be addressed to the Halifax and quote our reference number. The reference must be signed and dated, and the name and position of the person completing the reference must be provided. Any alterations must be clearly marked and initialled.
• For incomes received less frequently than monthly i.e. Yearly/Half Yearly/Quarterly e.g. bonus or commission, please key the lower of (a) the total income earned in the last 12 months or (b) the average of the income earned in each of the last 2 years. All payslips showing this income for the latest 2 years are required. For commission and non-annual bonuses, only income received from the current employer can be used and if commission/bonus received in the previous year was from a previous employer the 2 year average figure would be calculated using zero for the previous year. For annual bonuses if the latest year s bonus payment has been received from the current employer a previous year s bonus received from a previous employer can be included when calculating the 2 year average.
• Hand written payslips are acceptable, but only where the corresponding bank statements are also provided to confirm the income paid by the employer
• Bank statements must show the customer's full name or initial and surname and account number
• Internet bank statements must show bank heading/name and http address
• Benefit Award Letters must be dated within last 12 months and show the applicant name and monetary value of the allowance. The benefit must not be received on behalf of another person, e.g. a dependant.

### Maximum Working Age expandable section

We will use earned income up to the lower of the declared  Anticipated Retirement Age  or a maximum working age of 75.

The maximum working age applied will be 70 for:

If a term past 70 years of age is selected for an application restricted to a maximum working age of 70 a Corrective Action message will fire a Decision in Principle (DIP):  As the maximum working age on this application is 70 the term chosen extends into retirement, anticipated retirement income must be keyed or the term reduced to a maximum of   (years) .

The maximum working age applied will be 75 on product transfer and further advance applications.

The applicant's plans should be discussed in view of their occupation, and reasonability of working beyond state pension age should be documented where appropriate.

We will require a  Customer Working Age form  (PDF, 3.6MB) to be completed by all customers on an application where the mortgage term passes a working age of 70 for any customer. This form asks the customer(s) to confirm they have considered the implications of the term chosen and that they believe they can continue to work until the age indicated. The completed form will be required before we can proceed to offer.

Future retirement income will need to be verified where the customer is taking a mortgage term which extends beyond the lower of the declared  Anticipated Retirement Age  or the maximum working age being applied.

For applicants who are classed as self-employed, you should capture all of their income under the field "Net Profit". Whilst some self-employed income we allow is not truly 'net profit', we use this field in our affordability assessment and in our policy rules. The Net profit field should be completed as following:

We require self employed income details to be entered for the latest 2 years trading. Figures should only be entered for each full year of trading. Where the customer has been trading for less than 2 years but for at least one full year the application can be considered and accounts are then our preferred method of income verification. Additional information may be required to support any application.

We will accept self employed incomes which include government Self Employed Income Support Scheme (SEISS) grant income.

The income level used in our affordability calculation will be the lower of the latest year or the average of the last 2 years.

A maximum LTI of 4.49x will apply on some applications where there is any element of self-employed income   please see our Affordability, LTI and Income Multiples criteria.

### Second Job expandable section

In cases where the customer has more than one job, we will consider the following when deciding whether or not to take the secondary income into account. Hours worked, are they sustainable? Are the roles/skills similar? What is the distance between the jobs and the customers home? How long has the customer been in both jobs? Is the salary consistent with the type of employment? And the number of days the customer works per week.

Once all of the above has been taken into account and deemed acceptable, we will use the appropriate percentage of the second job income and it will be treated as per the standard income policy.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


### Acceptable Property Types expandable section

Each application will be assessed on its own merits although there are some property types which are specifically excluded.

Do we lend on any property? No. We require experienced RICS (Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors) qualified surveyors to consider all the factors that may affect the suitability of a property to be mortgaged and whether or not it is readily saleable. Factors may include property construction, type, location, uses and environmental issues. Each case will be assessed on its own merits. Some property types such as houseboats, mobile homes and timeshares are specifically excluded.

Do we lend on houses or flats/maisonettes made from precast reinforced concrete (PRC) that have been designated defective under the 1985 housing act? Generally not, unless the property has been repaired to a scheme that is approved by us. Flats/maisonettes which are designated defective PRC type are not acceptable.

Do we lend on PRC properties that have been repaired but have no repair certificate? No. However, we will accept a  retrospective repair certificate  confirming the repair has been undertaken to the standards laid down in the PRC Homes Repair Scheme or those accepted by us. The certificate must be in a format with wording required by us and prepared by a suitably qualified, experienced professional.

Do we lend on non-traditionally constructed properties? Yes, subject to inspection and design. Each case is considered on its own merits.

How big does the property have to be for a mortgage? Our general policy is to consider very property on its individual merits. We do not impose any size restrictions and no property is rejected solely on the grounds of size. A property must however meet the minimum criteria of being habitable, readily saleable and structurally sound.

The property is situated above a shop/commercial property, is it suitable for a mortgage? There are no specific restrictions although some commercial uses may have a detrimental effect on saleability and every case is viewed on its own merits. The following guidance may be helpful:

Do we lend on high rise flats? Every case is viewed on its own merits, subject to construction and saleability. Certain types e.g. large panel systems (LPS) have specific requirements.

Do we lend on properties with short leases? For leasehold properties to be acceptable, there must be a minimum of 70 years unexpired on the term of the lease at the time of the mortgage application.

Do we lend on houses or flats with solar panels/photo voltaic cells? We will not usually lend on blocks of leasehold flats where photo voltaic cells have been fitted, but there are some exceptions. Houses with leased solar panels are acceptable for lending providing the agreed lease is acceptable to us. This will be confirmed through the conveyancer or by checking our approved list. The valuer must be satisfied that the photo voltaic cells or solar panels have no impact on the structural integrity of the property and will be taken in to account when assessing value and saleability.

• Any residential security must have a suitable access, which must not be through a business premises.
• Caution must be exercised where the title of the residential property has been separated from a larger title that includes commercial activity, particularly when this has been done specifically for the purpose of the proposed mortgage. This can sometimes lead to an unusual residential property that may suit the proposed applicants but would be more difficult to sell on the open market. The residential security must meet the general principles regarding saleability.
• The property must be self-contained, with its own private facilities and separate services.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


### Assignable Contracts expandable section

Applications which involve assignable contracts or irrevocable powers of attorney in favour of intervening sellers are not acceptable. Any other structure to the transaction which has a similar effect should be reported to us. Assignable contracts allow the original buyer to sell the property before legal completion, by assigning the contract to buy the property to a new buyer after contracts have been exchanged with the developer.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


### Distressed sale and leaseback expandable section

Applications that involve a distressed sale or a sale and leaseback are not acceptable.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


### Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) expandable section

On purchase applications valid EPC details for the property are always required. On remortgages if the property has a valid EPC this must be captured, but if the property does not have a valid EPC the remortgage application can still proceed.

When property details are completed we will display on the EPC Details screen the latest EPC record to be used for the application. This EPC information comes from our database which is based on the Government EPC register. Please check the EPC showing is valid (within 10 years) and is the latest EPC available for the property. If the latest EPC is not showing details will need to be keyed:

The screen has a  Check EPC Register  button to open the Government register to see if a new EPC record shows, otherwise please refer to the customer who may need to speak to the agent/vendor or developer/builder to obtain the necessary information.

For the purchase of new build properties an EPC may not be available, we will accept a Predicted Energy Assessment (PEA) or Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP) rating and these details should be keyed.

On remortgage applications if an EPC does not exist for the property EPC details do not need to be manually keyed.

If EPC details are manually keyed and we request proof of the EPC this must be uploaded with the other verification documents e.g. EPC Certificate, PEA/SAP document for new build or where a property is  exempt  a completed exemptions template (PDF, 48KB).

A property s Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) rating is used in our affordability calculations allowing us to reflect a more tailored view of energy costs. A customer whose property has a higher EPC rating (e.g. A/B) will generally have lower energy costs than those with a lower EPC rating (F/G) on like-for-like use.

For properties with an A/B EPC rating you may see a small increase in the maximum loan amount available and for properties with an F/G EPC rating a small decrease. There is no change to the maximum loan available for properties with a C, D or E EPC rating or where the EPC is unknown.

• Current Energy Efficiency Rating
• Potential Energy Efficiency Rating
• EPC Certificate/Reference Number
• EPC date field ( Valid Until  for England/Wales/NI or  Date of Certificate  for Scotland).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


### EWS1 and Cladding expandable section

Due to provisions laid down under the Building Safety Act 2022 we will not require any further information on buildings containing 5 storeys and above in England and these applications can proceed as normal. For these properties we will ask the purchaser s conveyancer to gather information relating to the current leaseholder as there may be some situations where a leaseholder may have to contribute to cladding remediation. These cases will be referred by the purchaser s conveyancer for us to review further.

All high rise buildings in Wales (5 storeys or 11 meters and above) are eligible for remediation. We will not require any further information and these applications can proceed as normal.

For Scotland & Northern Ireland (all buildings) and buildings 4 storeys and below in England and Wales in line with RICS guidance to valuers we may ask for an EWS1 before a valuation figure can be provided. It is the responsibility of the building owner and/or its agent (in Scotland individual customers have to source the EWS1 form) as the responsible person to:

We will be unable to confirm if a property is acceptable until a valuation has been instructed.

For purchase cases a special condition will be added to a mortgage offer to instruct the conveyancer to advise the customer that the offer has been made on the reliance of an EWS1. It will also ensure that the customer knows that neither ourselves or surveying providers are liable for the information that was contained in the EWS1 form.

New Build

For new build high rise blocks over 18m / 6 storeys in height (England & Wales) or 11m / 4 storeys in height (Scotland) Building Regulation compliance, The Building (Amendment) Regulations 2018 or local equivalent can be relied on, subject to the conveyancer receiving confirmation of this from the building owner, and/or its agent or duty holder. Where this cannot be obtained the above criteria applies.

• Confirm that an external wall system (EWS) or attachments, such as a balcony, on buildings containing flats has been assessed by a suitable expert for likelihood of proportionate remediation to address fire safety risk.
• The EWS1 form must be prepared by a fully qualified competent member of a relevant professional body. Please see  Who carries out the EWS1 assessment, and what is their expertise?  on the RICS Cladding External Wall System (EWS) FAQs.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


### Japanese Knotweed expandable section

We will lend subject to the valuer confirming the property is suitable mortgage security and providing a present condition valuation figure. To assess the property the valuer will require a report outlining the issues and a quote from a treatment company who must either be a member of the Property Care Association or be able to offer a warranty backed treatment plan. If treatment is advised and where possible, then this is often over 3-4 years.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


### Property Condition expandable section

The property must meet minimum criteria. Must be habitable, readily saleable, structurally sound and be able to have buildings insurance arranged upon it. The mortgage advance may be wholly or partially retained pending completion of works required to bring the property to a suitable condition for lending.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


### Property Construction expandable section

Property acceptability is based on a satisfactory valuation report from the bank's appointed valuer. Non-standard construction will be assessed on individual merit. Certain types of pre-cast reinforced concrete (PRC) construction are designated defective and may not be acceptable unless repaired.

Timber or metal framed buildings where the cavity, between frame & cladding, has been retrospectively filled with an insulation material

Concrete walls as built in Cornwall or Devon before 1950 (1960 for postcodes PL12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 22 & 23) where valuer has recommended a Mundic report and test of the concrete has classified the concrete in either class B or C

Unrepaired, designated defective properties under the Housing Act 1985, Housing (Scotland) Act 1987, Housing (Northern Ireland) Order 1986 are not acceptable.

Flats or maisonettes of large panel system type unless acceptable structural appraisal on the whole block.

Load bearing panels of asbestos or gypsum plaster construction

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


### Property Tenure expandable section

• For leasehold property there must be a minimum of 70 years remaining on the lease at application, or the customer is extending the lease past 70 years as part of the purchase or remortgage application (a special condition will be added to the offer stating the offer is made on the assumption that the lease term is extended on or before completion). Lease terms less than 70 years that are not to be extended are only accepted on certain central London estates and subject to specific criteria.
• If a flat is leasehold and the applicant owns/will own on completion a share of the freehold of the whole building, the property should be keyed as leasehold and our charge will be registered on the leasehold interest only.
• Freehold flats are only considered where there are no more than four flats in the building, the applicant must own the freehold personally in their own name and will own one unit in the building. All other units must be subject to long leases (minimum 70 years). The security will be registered on the freehold of the whole building as a freehold house. If the applicant s own flat also has a lease the application would be for a leasehold flat and our charge must be registered on the freehold of the whole building and the leasehold interest of the unit.
• A flying freehold may be acceptable subject to surveyor guidance.
• Freehold Reversion (also known as Tyneside, Cross-Referred and Mirror) leases should be keyed as leasehold flats.
• Commonhold property is not accepted.
• The majority of properties in Scotland, including flats, hold the tenure  Ownership Interest  which can be selected from the tenure dropdown list. Please key  1 for ground rent and  1 for service charges/factor fees unless there is a charge in which case you would key the amount actually paid.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


### Property Use expandable section

• Property must be assessed as an individual residential property intended for owner occupation.
• Farms or property with land that is subject to commercial agricultural use, Commercial property and Timeshare are not acceptable.
• Limited incidental business use may be acceptable subject to property retaining residential status.
• Live / work schemes may be acceptable on mainstream lending only subject to compliance with planning condition and  work' element using less than 40% of the property.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


### Section 106 planning agreements / restrictive covenants expandable section

• Intended to regulate development or proposed use of property
• Range is varied but may include:
• Limiting occupation to a certain category of occupant - local residents, first time buyers, specified age requirement, specified employment types
• Restricting use of property - tied to agricultural use, restricting residential occupation to certain time limits, for example, 10 months of the year.
• The impact on acceptability depends upon the impact of the restriction. There may be a strong local demand for the property from qualifying purchasers.
• Broadly restrictions that mean a property must be used for agricultural use will be unacceptable.
• The valuer will determine the impact on the suitability of the property for lending and the conveyancer will determine whether the purchaser / owner complies with the obligation, advising the bank if any issues that may impact the lending.
• Where the restriction limits the time a property can be occupied this will only be acceptable for holiday homes / second home loans and subject to the valuer confirming the property is suitable for lending.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


### Scottish Properties expandable section

In Scotland how is property tenure keyed? The majority of properties in Scotland, including flats, hold the tenure  Ownership Interest  which can be selected from the tenure dropdown list. Please key  1 for ground rent and  1 for service charges/factor fees unless there is a charge in which case you would key the amount actually paid.

In Scotland would a flat above shops (commercial subject) be classed as suitable security for mortgage purposes? Yes, subject to inspection, each on its own merits and subjective assessment against lending criteria, comments and valuation.

In Scotland would a timber/ metal clad house be acceptable? Yes, subject to inspection, each on its own merits and subjective assessment against lending criteria, comments and valuation.

In Scotland is a retype on a new build or initial occupancy property permitted? No.

In Scotland would a retype from a home report on a buy to let mortgage be permitted, if there is rental valuation on the original Generic Mortgage Valuation Report/ Home Report? No. Following changes introduced by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Scotland) in early 2016, best practice advice is now that a rental valuation should not be provided in the Generic Mortgage Valuation Report attached to the Home Report.

Do we lend on Scottish Islands? Yes, in the main although this is subject to demand and saleability.

Would a retype for refinancing or remortgage purposes be accepted in Scotland? No.

Do we accept a retype from any Home Report? The Home Report must have been completed by an approved Firm on our Panel with the appropriate postcode authorisation. The report must have the correct property address and the inspection date must be no more than 12 weeks from the date of the original report.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


### Valuation Reports & Surveys expandable section

Can my clients appeal the Valuation? Yes they can, please view our appeals process for more information.

How long does it take for the valuation inspection to be carried out? These are for guidance purposes only and depending on other factors such as property type and size they may vary. For a Level 1 Valuation it will take approximately 30-40 minutes. A Level 2 Survey and Valuation will take approximately 90 minutes to 2 hours.

Where can I find information on your valuation fees? Details of our valuation fees.

Will the Surveyor need access to the property? If the valuation is a Level 1 Valuation or Level 2 Survey and Valuation then access will be required to the property and arrangements will be made directly with the occupier or agent.

Do you offer level 3 Building Surveys? No. Your client can find a surveyor to complete this for them, we do not offer Building Surveys.

Why are some instructions panelled? E.surv are our surveyor of choice and wherever possible will carry out the valuation instruction. However where e.surv do not have coverage or to ensure we meet the needs of your clients, the instruction may be panelled to a member of e.surv's Valuation Panel who are administered by e.surv. Both e.surv and the valuation panel follow the same lender guidance provided by us and are audited on a regular basis.

Why does my client need to sign the Terms of Engagement documentation you have sent them? Terms of Engagement are issued in order to reflect accurately the scope of the service to be provided so that your client is in a position to fully understand what service the firm is providing to them. As such, a report cannot be released to them until the Terms of Engagement have been read, signed and returned by the client.

Does my client need to provide the Surveyor with any paperwork when they visit the property? No, the surveyor will have all the information they need.

Does my client need to be present? No, as long as there is a person over the age of 18 that can let the surveyor in. Alternatively the surveyor can collect the key from a neighbour or estate agent for example.

Will the surveyor need access to the loft? For Level 1 Valuation inspections access is generally not needed, although there may be occasions when the surveyor will want to have access to complete their investigations. Access will always be required for the Level 2 Survey.

Is a copy of the Valuation Report sent to the solicitor? E.surv surveyors are unable to release valuation reports directly to solicitors. If your client requires a copy by post, fax or email then they must request it directly from e.surv. Please be aware that we cannot send reports to solicitors or any other third party at your client's request. We can only issue the report directly to your client.

Can I discuss an existing case with e.surv if I am not named on the application? E.surv are only able to discuss valuation instructions with an applicant named on the case. The named applicant can authorise us to discuss the case with another party by calling and setting up a specific agreed security password.

Does the Valuation Report contain an insurance or rebuild valuation figure? No, an insurance figure is generally not provided on the report. Your client can obtain an insurance figure independently by visiting the Association of British Insurers (ABI) website. The ABI website has a residential rebuilding cost calculator. Your client will be required to register with the website but can then log in and obtain a rebuilding/insurance figure for free.

What kind of comparable research on properties is used by the surveyor? Our reports are provided in accordance with the RICS Valuation   Professional Standards. When preparing reports, valuers compare evidence of recent sales in order to provide an opinion of value at a specific point in time. Ideally comparables include properties within the immediate locality offering similar accommodation and style to that of the subject property.

However, comparable evidence need not be identical and it is sometimes the case that no direct comparable evidence is available. In such cases the valuer will use their experience to adjust for any variances in matters such as size, condition and specific location or geographical appeal. Valuers consider a wide range of comparable evidence and their research is thorough.

Details of properties currently on the market and valuations provided by estate agents do not relate to realised sale values. Also, estate agent marketing appraisals are prepared for a different purpose than mortgage valuation or survey reports. Such information cannot be considered in lieu of comparable sales evidence.

My client has received an encrypted mail from e.surv, how do they open it? All emails containing sensitive and confidential information are sent using the Symantec secure email encryption service. The initial email will contain a link which takes your client to the Symantec service so they can register as a new user, including creating their own password. Symantec is not compatible with mobile devices therefore a desktop or laptop computer will be required to open the email (PDF, 547kB).

Will my client be charged a fee if the valuation is cancelled? A fee is not charged if the surveyor does not either visit the property or accept the instruction.

If the surveyor visits the property and finds it unsuitable they will complete a Level 1 Property Risk Assessment and confirm that they cannot give a valuation figure. They will point out that the property is unsuitable for lending and provide the reason. The valuation fee is payable in these circumstances.

Will you report on the property's condition? Level 1 Valuations are based on a limited inspection of the property highlighting only those items that are deemed to have a material impact on value. It is prepared in order for us to make an assessment of our loan to your client. It is not a survey of condition and is not designed to list individual property defects. It should not be relied on for their buying decision.

Level 2 Survey and Valuations report on specific condition matters and other issues to the extent outlined in the individual Terms of Engagement, which could affect a decision to buy. We base our lending decisions on the valuation aspects only.

Why might my client need a specialist report? Occasionally serious or potentially serious defects are found. The surveyor may not be able to provide a valuation without further investigation so a Specialist Report is requested. Serious defects warranting further investigation may include dry rot, structural movement, trees and drains but this is not an exhaustive list.

If a Structural Engineers Report is required this should be a focused report on the specific defect(s) referred to e.g. cracking, structural movement, subsidence, roof deflection, trees potentially causing damage, suspected drain failure etc. General reports on condition such as: Building Surveys, RICS Homebuyer reports etc. are not acceptable. The report must be addressed to our applicants and not the vendor, must detail the property address and must be signed off by a professional with the required qualifications, either:

For timber/dampness specialist reports the following qualifications are acceptable:

For drainage reports the following qualifications are acceptable:

• Structural Engineer (with qualification M.I.C.E, F.I.C.E, IM.I Struct E, M.I. Struct E or F.I Struct E.)

### Bank of England base rate changes expandable section

Tracker rates are linked to the Bank of England bank rate. This is announced from time to time by the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). If the MPC decides to change the bank rate, we will change the tracker rate in line with it. This will be within 30 days of the publication of the minutes of the MPC meeting at which the decision to change the bank rate was made.

At the end of the tracker rate period the tracker rate mortgage will cease to be a tracker rate mortgage and we will charge your client interest at:

Unless we write to tell them that we are prepared to allow the mortgage to remain a tracker rate mortgage.

All variable rates are stated at their current levels and are subject to change.

• Halifax Homeowner Variable Rate - for mortgages applied for after 4th January 2011.
• Halifax Standard Variable Rate - for mortgages applied for before 4th January 2011.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


### Consent to let expandable section

Also known as Consent to lease (CTL).

Existing Halifax mortgage customers looking to let their property should contact 03457 27 37 47. If we agree the consent to let we ll charge an added rate on top of their existing interest rate.

A new mortgage application can be considered for HM armed forces personnel on their intended main residence even where it is known that immediately following completion the property is to be let.

Further advance applications are available for mortgages on CTL subject to a maximum 75% loan to value (LTV).

Product transfer applications cannot proceed where CTL is registered. Certain exceptions apply including if the customer is HM armed forces personnel. If a property is no longer let and the customer now resides in the property, then the application can proceed as normal.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


### Early Repayment Charges expandable section

Some of our products have early repayment charges attached to them. An early repayment charge will apply if your client takes a product transfer or repays some or all of their mortgage during the early repayment charge period.

If your customer chooses a mortgage product with early repayment charges, as a concession, in any calendar year, they may repay up to 10% of the amount outstanding on their product, without having to pay an early repayment charge. We reserve the right to change or withdraw this concession at any time.

On a porting or product transfer application any Early Repayment Charge which may apply on your customer's current mortgage product will be waived if the product has 3 months or less to run.

The ERC will apply where the product has more than three months to run.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


### Existing Halifax Customer Moving Home expandable section

Existing Halifax Customers Moving Home

If the maximum loan available on affordability for a new application is below that required, the application may be considered on the loan amount required if all the below criteria are met:

There will be no discretion to proceed outside of these criteria and the application will be subject to a full review by our underwriters before we can confirm if it can proceed.

Customers named on the new mortgage application must be the same as those on the existing mortgage.

Please ensure you consider the full financial circumstances of the customer before submitting an application.

• Loan Amount - No increase in borrowing (new mortgage loan amount must be less than or equal to the existing mortgage balance)
• Monthly Payment - New monthly payment no more than 5% above existing payment
• Term - No increase in term for Interest only applications. For a full repayment application the term can increase, provided the new mortgage is not Lending into Retirement. Term reductions that would increase the monthly payment would be subject to an affordability review. If an existing term takes the applicant into retirement we will consider if the existing term is still acceptable.
• Arrears - No current arrears on existing mortgage
• LTV - An increase of up to 10% in loan to value (LTV) is acceptable, where the new LTV does not exceed 60% LTV (e.g. 45% to 55% LTV is allowable). Where the new LTV is above 60% there can be no increase above the existing LTV. The existing mortgage LTV can be calculated based on the sale price of the property rather than the indexed valuation
• Repayment Basis - No changes allowed
• Affordability - Maximum income multiple of 4.75x

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


### Financial Difficulty expandable section

Occasionally customers will find themselves in financial difficulties and requiring our assistance. We support customers throughout the life of their mortgage and will work with them to remedy any difficulties wherever possible.

Financial difficulty is defined by the following categorisation:

In all instances existing mortgage customers should be referred to the Payment Assistance Line : 0808 145 0437.

For all new lending, it is important customers in financial difficulty are identified as applications would not usually be considered.

For Mortgage Prisoners criteria, please see our Mortgage Prisoners section.

• Budgetary Issues: Able to afford current commitments and expenditure but poor at managing day to day control.
• Overspending: Able to afford current commitments but spending on non-essentials means an overall negative budget. Need to reduce spending in order to meet priority payments.
• Temporary Difficulties: Loss of job, sickness, relationship breakdown, bereavement etc. resulting in reduced income and unable to support current spending and/or commitments. Temporary assistance required until income level restored and/or spending permanently reduced.
• Over-committed: Unable to afford current commitments even after reducing non-essential spending. This may require restructuring of any unsecured credit commitments at non-concessionary rates and reduced spending to meet priority payments such as their mortgage.
• Over-indebted: Unable to afford current commitments and unable to reduce spending to make priority payments and budget affordable. It may require the ability to make reduced repayments within concessionary repayment plans.
• Severely Over-indebted: Unable to afford current commitments and unable to restructure/reduce spending to bring budget into balance. Only has the ability to offer token repayments which are insufficient to meet a concessionary repayment plan or refinancing loan.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


### Further Advance expandable section

Please see our Further advances page under Placing business for more information.

Your clients can borrow more money against the value of their home.

A combined further advance and product transfer application can be keyed, once the further advance funds have been released the product transfer will take effect from the 1st of the following month.

The list of acceptable reasons for a Further Advance are as follows:

Where the mortgage has been at least one month in arrears within the last 3 months, a further advance application cannot be accepted. The customer should be advised to bring their account up to date and be  arrears free' for at least 3 months before re-applying.

If a mortgage is non-FCA regulated and a further advance is required, to give the client the regulatory protection for the entire mortgage, the existing debt is refinanced to make the whole mortgage FCA Regulated.

If a further advance application has not passed our credit score please see our Appeal Credit Score Decline section.

• The additional borrowing is secured against their existing Halifax mortgage.
• Further advance applications will not be permitted within 6 months of completion of the original mortgage.
• Maximum 2 further advances allowed in a 12-month period.
• Minimum Further Advance loan amount  5,000
• Maximum 85% Loan to Value
• Where above 80% LTV (based on current indexed valuation) a revaluation will be required and a revaluation fee will be due.

• Consumer goods
• Debt consolidation
• Gift to relative
• Home improvements (shared ownership included)
• Investment purpose (restriction - not for currency speculation or the purchase of stocks and shares)
• Purchase freehold - (conveyancer required)
• Purchase additional land adjacent to property (conveyancer required)

• Purchase additional share (shared ownership)
• Repay subsequent charge

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


### Overpayments & Payment Holidays expandable section

Overpayments

Lump sum or regular overpayments can be made at any time. If early repayment charges apply to the product, refer to early repayment charges for more details.

Payment holidays

If your clients wish to take a payment holiday and if they meet criteria it may be possible for them to take up to a maximum of 6 months over the lifetime of their mortgage. One holiday is allowed every 3 years with a maximum of 2 months per instance.

A payment holiday can be requested for any reason and each circumstance should be individually assessed using questioning skills to establish if this is the correct method to support the customer.

It is very important that your client has not indicated they are in financial difficulty, and the purpose for the request is both reasonable and in their best interest. It is important to remember that a payment holiday is a short term solution for short term need.

If your client does take a payment holiday they need to be aware that the interest usually charged will be added to the balance of the mortgage.

Their account will be recalculated at the end of the payment holiday and written confirmation will be sent out approximately 2 weeks before their payment will restart. The monthly payment will be calculated at that time using the higher balance and spread throughout the remaining term.

If they have any sub accounts on Interest Only they need to be aware that these balances will increase to cover the amount of accrued interest that has been added due to the missed payments. Therefore, they will need to check that their repayment plan is on track to repay this mortgage at the end of the term.

Whilst your client has an active payment holiday, they will be ineligible to apply for a Further Advance or a Mortgage Review. They can only proceed with an application if they stop the payment holiday, or wait until it has ended.

Criteria

• The mortgage must have been open for at least 12 months with no further borrowing in the last 6 months.
• The account must not be in arrears at the time of the application or have had any historic arrears on the account (in the last 12 months).
• The account must not have had any missed payments in the past 12 months.
• There must be no payment arrangement in force or have been within the last 6 months.
• The total debt on the mortgage must not exceed 75% at point of application; there will be the option for a revaluation (fee applicable).
• The mortgage property must not be on a Shared Ownership scheme.
• The mortgaged property must be the Main Residence, and is not rented out.
• Customer(s) must not currently be claiming on a Mortgage Repayments Insurance policy or be applying for, or be in receipt of, Income Support.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


### Porting Applications expandable section

If an existing Halifax mortgage is repaid while an Early Repayment Charge (ERC) applies this charge will be due unless the amount on the existing product is ported to a new application, when the ERC will be waived. The ERC can also be waived without porting, if a new mortgage is being taken in the last 3 months of the ERC period. In a non-simultaneous sale and purchase scenario the ERC has to be paid but can be refunded as explained below.

Please notify us when you submit any new application for an existing Halifax mortgage customer, by advising the colleague when making an initial call or by completing the Contact form (PDF, 35kB) held on our Literature page and uploading this. Please explain if the product is being ported or if not why so we can take the necessary actions.

If a product is portable this is outlined in the original mortgage offer and supporting documentation. You cannot port a product onto a remortgage application from another lender, but can port to a remortgage of an unencumbered (mortgage free) property the customer already owns, where this will become their main residence.

Where Halifax Standard Variable Rate is the reversionary rate which applies to the product being ported, it will continue to be the reversionary rate for the amount of the new mortgage which is on the ported product. Any extra amount borrowed on the new mortgage must be on a product from the current range and applicable scheme. The reversionary rate which applies to that product and the amount on it will be Halifax Homeowner Variable Rate.

To port a product the new mortgage application must complete simultaneously with redemption of the current mortgage. The conveyancer must indicate a product is being ported when they obtain a redemption statement for the existing mortgage; the statement will then explain that the ERC does not need to be included in the redemption monies.

If the amount to be ported to a new loan is lower than the amount currently on the product the ERC payable will be calculated on a pro rata basis. For example, if  100,000 of  200,000 on the existing product is being ported then 50% of the ERC would be charged. If the new mortgage application is completing simultaneously with redemption of the current mortgage only the partial ERC would need to be paid upon redemption.

Within the last 3 months of an ERC period the product does not need to be ported to a new mortgage; as long as the new loan amount is not lower than the existing amount on the product with ERCs, a product from the new current range can be chosen for the new mortgage and the early repayment charge will be waived.

Where a customer sells their property and repays their existing mortgage before they complete on a new purchase, they will incur any ERCs that apply. However, if they apply for a new mortgage with us within three months of repaying their existing mortgage, while they cannot port and would choose a new product from the current range at that time, once the new mortgage has completed we will process a refund of the ERC.

This is a concession and it may not always be available. The new loan amount must not be lower than the amount previously on the product, or a partial refund of the ERC will be received on a pro rata basis. During the processing of the new application you should tell us where a refund of an ERC will be required or complete a Contact form (PDF, 35kB). You should also call us when the new mortgage completes so we can request the refund of the ERC is actioned.

Buy to Let mortgage products cannot be ported onto non Buy to Let mortgages.

To key to port a product on a new application:

• Make sure 'Existing Customer' has been chosen as 'Purchase Type' on Personal Details screen.
• On the Products selection screen complete 'Roll number' or 'Account Number' with the customer's existing mortgage account:
• The 'Roll number' is their original application roll number - if the final digit after the dash is a single digit remember to input a zero ahead of this e.g. for 9 key '09'; 10/12345678-9 is keyed as 101234567809
• Or key 'Account Number' in a 14 digit format e.g. 10/12345678-9 should be keyed as 10123456780900 including a zero ahead of the final digit if this is a single digit and two zeros at the end to make 14 digits.
• Any products available to port will then show.
• Please ensure the customer's name, date of birth and address details are keyed correctly on the new application to exactly match the existing mortgage as shown in Mortgage Enquiry, for the portable product(s) to show available.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


### Product Transfers expandable section

Please see our Product transfer page under Placing business for more information.

Product transfers (PT) applications can be submitted at any time in the month. The earliest a product transfer can take effect is the 1st of the following month. Where the customer is within the last 4 months of an existing product they can forward date with no Early Repayment Charge, the new product will start on the 1st of the following month after the current product has ended.

Where the customer is within the last 3 months of an existing product you can choose to either start the new product from the 1st of the following month and we will waive any Early Repayment Charge OR forward date the new product to start after the current product has ended.

If a mortgage is in arrears the account must be brought up to date before a PT application can be keyed.

We will be undertaking affordability checks on product transfers where there are material changes which affect affordability; where the customer is lending into retirement, reducing their term on the Capital and Interest element of the mortgage, changing repayment type or where they do not have adequate repayment vehicles in place.

Any documentation requested must be received in sufficient time for the product transfer to be offered before the end of the month prior to the date of effect.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


### Retirement Home Plan (RHP)/ Lifetime expandable section

Customers should contact Halifax on 0345 727 3747 in the first instance where they will be provided with details of how to progress their requirements.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


### Subsequent charges (SCG) expandable section

If a SCG is present your local processing centre will contact you if there is a problem with the SCG type or problems in obtaining a Letter of Postponement (LOP).

If any of the following SCG reasons are present the further advance cannot proceed:

If the SCG is registered to a non-clearing bank and is to be repaid, a conveyancer must be instructed.

If the client does not intend to repay the SCG using the further advance and will therefore continue after completion, Halifax will request a Letter of Postponement (LOP) from the SCG lending company. If the LOP is not granted the further advance cannot proceed. It is not unusual for the SCG lending company to refuse to grant an LOP.

• Bankruptcy inhibition.
• Bankruptcy order.
• Creditors notice.
• Drug trafficking offence.
• Receiving order.
• Sequestration.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


### Appeal Credit Score Decline expandable section

Credit Score Decline - Appeals

All applications will be credit scored. If an application is declined as it has not passed the credit score customers have a right to appeal and whilst we'll always reconsider carefully, without new information it is very unlikely that we will be able to change our decision.

This also applies where an application is declined on policy because of  the level of unsecured debt outstanding' or because  an active pay day loan is present'.

Please give careful consideration before submitting an appeal for assessment. The list below provides guidance on the scenarios in which an appeal may be successful:

Existing Halifax Mortgage Customers

Moving house with no increase in loan amount or loan to value (LTV) compared with the current mortgage.

BFPO Address

The client is in the British Armed Forces and living at a BFPO address.

Victim of Fraud

The fraud has been reported to the Police and Credit Industry Fraud Avoidance system (CIFAS) and can be evidenced by a crime reference number.

Adverse Credit Data Registered in Error

An error by Lloyds Banking Group can be evidenced.

If the adverse information has been registered on a non-Lloyds Banking Group product an appeal cannot be submitted and the customer should arrange for their records to be corrected before a new application is submitted.

For scenarios that fall outside of this list it is likely the final decision will remain unchanged.

Please refer to our Credit Scoring leaflet (PDF, 173KB).

Further Advances

Please give careful consideration before submitting an appeal for assessment, the list above provides guidance on the scenarios in which an appeal may be successful.

We may still be able to consider an application required to complete essential repairs to the property   please contact us.

If the property being purchased is not changing but an amendment is required to the address keyed e.g. property number or street name this must be amended by us prior to completion. You should contact us to make this change.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


### Decision in Principle (DIP) expandable section

### Fee Payment - Acceptable Cards expandable section

We can accept debit or credit cards to pay a fee required on an application. Amex, Diners Club and Discovery are not accepted.

It is the intermediaries responsibility to record whenever a product fee is paid upfront. If a product fee has been paid upfront and the application is not proceeding, or the application is proceeding but the product selected is changed, you must contact us so the refund of the fee paid can be actioned.

For further support on our valuation fees, please refer to our Valuation fees.

### ID & Address Verification expandable section

### 90-95% loan to value expandable section

Applications above 90% to 95% loan to value (LTV) are available for purchase applications.

The following criteria applies to loans above 90% LTV:

• Available to first time buyers and homemovers for purchase applications
• A minimum 5% personal deposit is required and product fees cannot be added above 95%
• This must be the customers only residence and they must not have an interest in any other properties such as a second home or buy to let
• New build houses/bungalows (not flats) are included
• Maximum purchase price of  600,000 and maximum loan of  570,000
• Specific lending limits apply on our affordable housing schemes e.g. shared equity, shared ownership and right to buy. Please see the criteria section for each scheme for more information
• An enhanced credit score requirement will be applied
• A maximum 4.49x loan to income (LTI) cap will be applied as part of our affordability assessment
• Current credit commitments will be deducted as ongoing in our affordability calculation even when declared as  to be repaid  at or before completion. The loan amount must be affordable with these commitments deducted as remaining
• Lending into retirement is allowed subject to normal criteria

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


### Concessionary and family purchase expandable section

The property purchase is solely for the applicant(s) to live in as their main residence and the applicant is:

The only relationships permitted for a concessionary purchase are (including vice versa):

All family purchase transactions must provide vacant possession (the vendor must be moving out) on completion. In all cases the discount on the purchase price must be a minimum of 10% of the market value and must be a genuine discount (must not be subject to any future repayment, clawback or retained interest terms).

For inherited properties where a beneficiary is purchasing the other beneficiaries share, this should be keyed as a concessionary purchase. The purchase price will be the amount required to buy out the other beneficiaries.

Example: Mr Smith has died leaving the property valued at  200,000 to his two sons; therefore each beneficiary has a share of  100,000. Only one son wants the property and wishes to buy out the brother's shares. In this scenario, the purchase price would be  100,000 as the applicant already owns 50% of the property.

A valuation must be instructed in all cases including properties in Scotland (retypes are not permitted).

Note: As the application results can differ on these cases once the correct purchase price has been keyed, you must contact The Halifax Intermediary Processing Team for all applications for Concessionary Purchase. This will ensure correct underwriting of the case has been carried out at the time of application.

• Purchasing from an immediate family member (see definition below) or partner/ex-partner at a discounted price (minimum of 10% discount is required) and the vendor must move out on completion.

• A sitting tenant purchasing from their landlord (private or council) at a discounted price (minimum of 10% discount is required). This excludes Right to Buy. The tenant must have been subject to a tenancy agreement on the property for a minimum of 1 year.

### First Homes Scheme expandable section

The Government First Homes scheme in England allows First Time Buyers (FTB) to purchase a New Build property at a discounted purchase price under a Resale Price Covenant (RPC). The discount (which will be a minimum 30%) must be passed on if the property is sold in the future.

Key eligibility criteria for First Homes scheme:

Mortgage criteria:

Example:

A 5% personal deposit is required in addition to any incentives from the builder. The loan amount together with any incentives and any product fee being added, cannot exceed 95% of the discounted purchase price. For product selection the percentage LTV used will be loan amount against the full market value (not discounted purchase price).

On Halifax Intermediaries Online the  First Homes  scheme should be selected on the Scheme screen and you will then be asked to key the percentage discount. On the Loan screen key the discounted purchase price.

The customer should obtain an Authority to Proceed (ATP) from the Local Authority. A Decision In Principle (DIP) can be keyed before ATP has been obtained by selecting the new scheme and a full application should only be submitted after ATP has been granted.

A Special Condition on the mortgage offer will state that an RPC will apply to the property. Affordable Housing Scheme Guidance Notes will be issued automatically to the conveyancer with the offer.

Remortgages

Remortgages of properties initially purchased under the First Homes scheme are accepted. Please select the First Homes scheme and key the percentage (%) discount applied when the property was originally purchased. On the Loan screen key the estimated property value after the percentage discount is applied e.g. if the estimated full market value is  250,000 and a 40% discount applied when the property was initially purchased key  150,000 as the estimated property value.

Products should be selected from the Affordable Housing Remortgage range; the loan to value (LTV) for selecting the product is the loan amount against the full market value.

Product transfer (PT) and further advance (FA) applications

Please see the Product Finder within Mortgage Enquiry for the available products. The loan to value (LTV) for product selection will be the loan amount against the full value of the property. Further advance applications are not available until a mortgage has been open for 6 months. The maximum 85% LTV for FA applications is based on the loan amount against the property valuation after the percentage discount is applied.

We continue to accept RPC schemes which are not part of the First Homes initiative. Please see Resale Price Covenant (RPC) criteria.

• All applicants must be a First Time Buyer. Local Authorities may prioritise key workers, local residents and service personnel.
• In England only.
• New Build properties only.
• Maximum purchase price, after discount, is  250,000 ( 420,000 in London).
• Discount typically 30% but Local Authorities can increase up to 50%.
• Customer maximum income of  80,000 ( 90,000 in London).

• Minimum 5% personal deposit based on discounted purchase price.
• First Homes scheme specific products must be selected (for remortgages Affordable Housing remortgage range applies).
• Mortgage must be on a capital and interest repayment basis, no interest only.
• Minimum 50% Loan to Value (LTV) based on discounted purchased price.

### First Time Buyers (FTB) expandable section

To qualify for a FTB product, one applicant must not have previously had a mortgage or purchased a property (including bought for cash) either in the UK or abroad. In instances where an applicant has owned (such as inherited) but not previously bought a property they are classified as a FTB. For joint applicants, only one applicant needs to be a FTB to qualify for a FTB product.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


### Mortgage Prisoner expandable section

Customers classed as Mortgage Prisoners by the FCA due to their current mortgage being held with a closed book lender may be able to remortgage to the Halifax. Applications will be subject to our criteria, credit scoring and affordability assessment.

If a remortgage application passes our credit score but fails our affordability assessment we may still be able to consider the application. The customer must be remortgaging from a closed book lender and have received a letter from their existing lender stating they are classed as a Mortgage Prisoner. The remortgage application would need to meet the following criteria:

If an Alternative Lending Proposal (ALP) application result is received this indicates the application has passed our credit score but failed the affordability assessment. If all of the above criteria are met please select the  Mortgage Prisoner' scheme in Halifax Intermediaries Online and submit the full application. You should complete and upload the Mortgage Prisoner form (PDF, 124kB) and all required documentation.

Even if the above criteria are met the level of credit score achieved will be considered and the application will still be subject to a full review before we can confirm if we are able to proceed.

It is important the customer has checked if there are any other financial interests registered against the property (for example if there is a second charge or charging order) and if so that these will either be removed or postponed so that Halifax has a first charge.

In many cases due to the nature of the interest it will be clear from the outset that postponement is not possible and it will be necessary for the debt to the third party to be repaid on or before completion. If it becomes apparent that the Halifax mortgage cannot be registered as a first charge because of any third party interest in the property the new mortgage will not be able to proceed.

• A remortgage of the customer's main residence with no additional borrowing (excluding any fees).
• Maximum 75% loan to value (LTV).
• Interest Only lending is acceptable subject to verification of acceptable repayment plans for the whole amount of interest only per our normal criteria.
• The customer's new monthly payment must be no more than 5% higher than the current monthly payment.
• The mortgage cannot be on a Shared Equity or Shared Ownership scheme.
• The customer must not be in Financial Difficulty. Please see the definition of  Financial Difficulty'.

The loan amount plus any incentives plus any product fee being added cannot exceed 95%.

Cash incentives for shared equity applications are acceptable provided the total value of the loan plus incentive together does not exceed 95% of the value of the equity share being purchased.

### Resale price covenant (RPC) and discount market scheme (DMS) expandable section

The customer acquires a 100% ownership of the property at a discounted price and the seller does not retain any percentage or own a share of the property. The discounted purchase price is provided by way of the property being subject to a "Covenant", contained in the Section 106/75 planning agreement. This is a restriction to ensure that the "Discount" is always passed on to future buyers.

Discount Market Scheme (DMS) is another name for RPC.

We will only accept a scheme where the resale price is based upon a certain percentage of market value and not on a house price and/or income index.

Customers can sometimes buy out of the restriction however we do not require this as part of the scheme.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


### Shared Equity (including Help to Buy) expandable section

Lets your customer buy a home by sharing the equity with a third party.

Example: 80/20 Shared Equity purchase Purchase Price =  100,000 Your customer's share =  80,000 Your customer deposit =  5,000 Mortgage required =  75,000 The maximum financial incentive which is permitted =  1,000 (95% of  80,000 =  76,000)

Calculate equity loan interest payments as follows:

Amount of equity retained by the builder/shared equity loan provider =  20,000 (20% of  100,000 full value)

Rate of interest payable (confirmed by customer) = e.g. 4%

 20,000 x 4% =  800 per annum

 800 / 12 =  67 to be keyed in  Monthly interest payments  field.

• Local Authority, Housing Association or Government schemes are acceptable but we cannot accept applications on private shared equity schemes i.e. where the equity loan is provided by a Private Company, Developer or Builder.
• Halifax must have first charge. The seller secures their interest by way of a second charge.
• The following limits apply and the loan to full value of the property must not exceed normal lending limits:
• The equity share being purchased must be between 25% and 90%.
• The equity loan must be a minimum of 10%.
• Customer must always provide a minimum personal deposit of 5% based on the purchase price of the whole property.
• The mortgage must be a maximum of 85% LTV based on the purchase price of the whole property.
• Purchase price limits may differ depending on the scheme. For Help to Buy Wales, the maximum property value from 01/04/2023 is  300,000. Please refer to the Welsh Government's scheme rules.
• The mortgage must be on a repayment basis. We do not allow any remortgage applications, where there is any element of debt consolidation.
• The term of the mortgage must be shorter than or equal to the equity loan term.
• We will apply an income multiple cap of four and a half times income on all affordable housing (shared equity and shared ownership) applications, including Help to Buy Equity Loans.
• Client must pay a 5% personal deposit (excluding any deposit provided by a builder or housing association). Cash incentives are acceptable provided the loan and cash incentive together do not exceed 95% of the value of the customer's equity share.
• If the customer is required to make interest payments for the equity loan this must be confirmed and the correct interest figure keyed for the application to proceed. The interest figure must be entered in  Monthly Interest Payments' field on the Schemes screen and not as a commitment under Credit Commitments. The interest charge must be keyed and taken into account in the affordability calculation even if interest is not payable from the start. For schemes with planned payment increases the higher figure should be keyed e.g. if in years 1-5 is 3% but increases to 5% from year 6, the 5% figure must be keyed.
• Only if the customer will never pay any interest should a zero figure be keyed.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


### Shared Ownership expandable section

Shared ownership allows a customer to buy a home in stages. The customer purchases a property jointly with either a Housing Association, also known as a Registered Social Landlord or a Local Authority.

The customer will own a percentage of the property, with the remaining percentage being owned by the Housing Association/Local Authority. The terms of this arrangement is set out in a shared ownership lease.

When a customer applies for a mortgage to buy a shared ownership property we are only lending on a specific percentage of the property value which means the customer will own a share of the property and pay rent to the Housing Association/Local Authority for the remaining share. Some shared ownership schemes may be aimed at members of the public such as key workers.

Shared Ownership is only available where the share being purchased is between 20% and 85% of the property s value for new build properties and 25% and 85% of the property's value for non-new build properties. The maximum loan against the customers share is subject to normal lending limits to a maximum of 95% for both second hand and new build purchases (houses/bungalows and flats), unless the property is a new build conversion or renovation where we will restrict this to 80% of the share being purchased. See below for restrictions in Scotland & Northern Ireland.

For shared ownership the customer must pay a 5% personal deposit of the share being purchased (minimum  4,000 and excluding any deposit provided by a builder or housing association). Product fees cannot be added above 95%. Cash Incentives for shared ownership are acceptable provided the total value of the loan plus incentive plus any product fee being added together does not exceed 95% of the value of the share being purchased.

Shared ownership mortgages must be held on a repayment basis and affordability will be capped at 4.49 times income.

Proof of the rental payment to be made will be required on all shared ownership scheme applications:
