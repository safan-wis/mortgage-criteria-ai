#### Age

All applicants must be aged 18 or over, and they must be no more than 75 years old at the end of the mortgage term.

For applicant(s) that cannot provide evidence of adequate pension income, the maximum age is their stated anticipated retirement age (no greater than 70 years old) or state retirement age, where no anticipated retirement age has been provided.

Additional criteria apply where the mortgage term extends beyond the applicants' retirement age. Please see Lending into retirement.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


#### Address history

We require three years' UK address history for all applicants. Where an applicant is not able to provide three years' UK address history, non-UK addresses should be recorded and the case reviewed on its own merits.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


#### Number of applicants

We allow up to four applicants on a mortgage application. However, we will only take into account a maximum of two applicants' income when assessing maximum affordability.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


#### Residency status

Applicants must currently be resident in the UK and have permanent leave to remain.

For foreign nationals (excluding Republic of Ireland) each applicant must have been granted indefinite leave to remain or right of abode to live and work in the UK or settled/pre-settled status to live and work in the UK. We will require one of the following documents as evidence:

In addition we require evidence of two years' residency and employment history in the UK.

Applicants must not hold any level of diplomatic immunity.

If the above cannot be demonstrated then the application will be declined.

• eVisa / manual Share code confirming Indefinite Leave to Remain / Settled or Pre-Settled status - more information can be found here
• Valid Passport containing Indefinite Stamp
• Home Office letter with no expiration date

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


#### Credit check

All applicants are credit searched before a mortgage is offered. This is usually completed at Decision In Principal. Obtaining a Decision In Principal will record a soft footprint against the applicant's credit record(s); it is when the full application is submitted that a hard footprint is left.

When completing a credit search on your client we are required to leave a footprint highlighting that we've performed a search connected with mortgage lending when a full application is submitted, this will leave a hard footprint. Multiple credit searches over a short period may adversely affect your client's credit rating and you should explain this to your client before submitting their application.

Additional checks will also be carried out to verify the identity of the applicants. Please refer to our Privacy Notice for further details.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

We will also consider the impact of possible future interest rate increases on the long term affordability of the mortgage.

The actual loan amount will be subject to: a full credit score, affordability assessment, review of current credit commitments and our current lending policy.
