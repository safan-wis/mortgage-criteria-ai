# Affordability types

### We have two types of BTL assessment, rental cover and top slicing.

##### Rental cover

Under a rental cover assessment, the rental income must cover the mortgage payment by a minimum ICR (Interest Cover Ratio) based on the relevant Stress Rate

This is the assessment we use for all portfolio landlords, and we use it for non-portfolio landlord cases unless top slicing could help.

### We have no minimum income for a rental cover assessed BTL.

### You can find our minimum ICRs and stress rates under ourrental cover criteria.

##### Top slicing

Top slicing uses a customer’s spare personal income to boost their borrowing amount, by allowing a lower ICR than we may otherwise allow.

### We consider top slicing for non-portfolio landlords.

### Check ourtop slicing criteria.

##### Affordability calculator

### Ouraffordability calculatorwill let you know how much we could lend.

It will first look at whether we could lend the amount requested using our stressed ICR rental cover assessment.

If we can’t get to the amount you need but our top slicing assessment might help, it will then ask for personal income details.


3. Age
   Link: #age
============================================================

# Age

• The minimum age at the start of the application is 21 for the first named applicant, and 18 for any additional applicants

• The maximum age at the end of the mortgage term is 85 and 364 days. If top slicing is used, the maximum age at the end of the mortgage term is 75 and 364 days

5. Assignable contracts
   Link: #assignable-contracts
============================================================

# Assignable contracts

### We do not lend on assigned contracts.

This is where a vendor allows the assignment of a purchase contract from the original buyer to a new buyer before completion.


6. Back to back transactions
   Link: #back-to-back-transactions
============================================================

# Back to back transactions

##### Purchase

Also known as a sub-sale, we allow a purchase where the seller has not yet owned the property for 6 months. We will use the lower of the original purchase price (estate valuation if inherited) and the current valuation, unless the seller has significantly improved the property increasing its value, then we can use the current valuation (or new purchase price if lower).

The seller’s ownership must be registered at Land Registry. For new builds the valuer will need to see the original Disclosure of Incentives Form.

##### Remortgage

Also known as a day one remortgage, we allow a remortgage within 6 months of purchasing or inheriting a property.

Within the first 6 months we will use the lower of the original purchase price (estate valuation if inherited) and the current valuation, unless the customer has significantly improved the property increasing its value, then we can use the current valuation. The new ownership must be registered at Land Registry.

Where a property has been gifted, we will not allow a remortgage within the first 6 months of ownership.

##### Contact us before applying

### You need to let us know if a case is a back to back transaction before applying.


7. Background buy-to-lets
   Link: #background-buy-to-lets
============================================================

# Background buy-to-lets

Checks and limits for background BTLs depend on whether the application is for a portfolio landlord. A portfolio landlord is someone who will have 4 or more mortgaged properties on completion of the new loan. This includes any BTLs held in an SPV, and for a joint application includes all mortgages whether they’re held together or separately.

##### Non-portfolio BTL

### Maximum with Virgin Money

The maximum number of BTL properties mortgaged with Virgin Money is 5 with the total balance of all mortgages not exceeding £3,000,000.

### Maximum portfolio

The maximum number of mortgaged BTL properties a customer can have with all lenders, including the property being mortgaged with us is 3, otherwise they’re classed as a portfolio landlord. This includes any BTLs held in an SPV.

### Minimum background rental cover

### There are no minimum background rental cover requirements.

##### Portfolio BTL

The maximum number of mortgaged BTL properties a customer can have with all lenders, including the property being mortgaged with us is 10. This includes any BTLs held in an SPV.

### Portfolio tests

The background BTL portfolio must have an aggregate maximum LTV of 75% and cover its mortgage payments by 135% at a stressed interest rate of 5%. This excludes the mortgage being placed with us but includes any other mortgaged or unmortgaged BTLs including where held in an SPV. Additionally, the customer cannot have more than 5 BTLs in the same post code, for example, G2 7ER.

### Like for like remortgage

Where the application being placed with us is a remortgage with no additional borrowing there is no maximum number of background BTLs, and the portfolio LTV and post code tests do not apply. The background BTL portfolio must cover its mortgage payments by 125% at a stressed interest rate of 5%. This excludes the mortgage being placed with us but includes any other mortgaged or unmortgaged BTLs including where held in an SPV. The maximum with Virgin Money of 5 BTLs and £3,000,000 balances still apply.

9. Bonus and variable income
   Link: #bonus-and-variable-income
============================================================

# Bonus and variable income

### The following information relates to our treatment of income for top slicing.

We accept 100% of contractually guaranteed income from a customer’s primary employment. For example, a contractual car allowance, large city weighting or permanent shift allowance.

We accept 60% of variable income that’s regular and reliable. For example, bonus, commission or overtime.

📊 📊 Table: Variable pay frequency, Income used

• Variable pay frequency: Monthly or more regular
  • Income used: 60% of the lowest of the last 2 monthsIf the year to date figure is lower, we’ll use 60% of the variable pay showing in the YTD.

• Variable pay frequency: Annual, Half-yearly, Quarterly
  • Income used: 60% of the most recent yearIf the total variable pay is more than basic pay, we use 60% of the 2 year average, or more recent if lower.

Exceptionally, we may be able to use up to 75% of variable income where a 3 year track record of stability is held (2 years if monthly or more regular). This must be agreed with us before applying.

   Link: #capital-raising
============================================================

# Capital raising

##### Allowable purposes

11. Cladding
   Link: #cladding
============================================================

# Cladding

##### New mortgage applications

### Multi storey buildings which have multiple occupancy and are either:

• Under 11 metres AND 4 storeys or less, anywhere in the UK, or

• 11 metres or more OR 5 storeys or more, in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland

Our valuation policy will ensure that a professional valuation is undertaken for these properties. Where the valuer has fire safety concerns with the External Wall System or any other fire safety concerns, they will request a completed External Wall Fire Review Form (EWS1), in line with RICS guidance. Our appointed valuer will check their database to confirm the property’s EWS1 status. Where they are unable to do so, we will request the EWS1 form. The EWS1 form should be sent directly to us.

The EWS1 form is the responsibility of the building owner (property owner in Scotland) to undertake. They must appoint a qualified member of one of the appropriate professional bodies to complete and sign the form. The form will confirm that the EWS has been assessed and provide its safety rating. The rating will determine whether we are able to progress the case.

A rating of A1, A2 or B1 will mean that the valuer will determine whether the case can progress and where acceptable, provide an amended valuation report.

A rating of A3 or B2 will mean that the property will be declined where affected by cladding and remediation is required.

### Multi storey buildings in England which have multiple occupancy and are either:

• 11 metres or more, or

• Have 5 or more storeys

Where a valuer has identified any significant fire safety concerns, or the EWS1 form rating is either A3 or B2, they’ll let us know if remediation of the property has been agreed to be funded by either Government funding or by the Developer, if known. We’ll then get in touch requesting the following:

• An executed Leaseholder Deed of Certificate.

• An executed Landlord Certificate (for applications where the building is being fully remediated under the Building Safety Act or by the Developer, this certificate will not be required).

Please note that we aren’t accepting applications fromnon-qualifying leaseholdersfor buildings that are not being remediated under the Building Safety Act.

We must be satisfied with the information provided to allow us to proceed. You can find more guidance on this documentation on thegovernment website.

##### Existing mortgages

We are here to support our existing customers who have a mortgage on a property that is impacted by potentially unsafe EWS. When their current mortgage deal ends we will offer a new mortgage product, just as we always would.

For changes to an existing Virgin Money mortgage we will assess each case based on individual circumstances. As a responsible lender, any application for additional borrowing from customers impacted by unsafe EWS will be carefully considered before a decision is made.

For any other questions relating to EWS please refer to theFAQsprovided by RICS or visit theGovernment’s websiteto view their guidance on cladding.

We accept consumer BTL applications from brokers with the necessary permissions, and our lending criteria and product range are the same for non-regulated BTL and consumer BTL mortgages.


13. Contractors
   Link: #contractors
============================================================

# Contractors

### The following information relates to our treatment of income for top slicing.

##### Daily rate contractors

• We will lend to daily rate contractors who have a fixed rate of pay, work schedule and contract duration

• Income is calculated by the current contract multiplied by 46 weeks

• The maximum gap between contracts is 6 weeks. If there is more than a 6 week gap, please contact us - we may still be able to help

• Contractors who earn £50,000 or more must have 1 year’s contracting experience or 2 years’ experience in same the industry

• Contractors who earn under £50,000 must have 2 years’ contracting experience. There is no minimum income requirement

• If there is less than 1 month remaining on the current contract, evidence of renewal must be held

• It is acceptable for a contractor to have a limited company providing they do not employ other contractors or have more than one contract. Offshore structures are not accepted

##### IR35 and umbrella companies

• Contractors operating inside IR35 and/or use of a payroll services company (PAYE umbrella company) are accepted

• When reviewing payslips, we will deduct any statutory employer costs (including employer National Insurance contributions and Apprenticeship Levy) and any payroll service costs from the gross pay before multiplying by 46 weeks

##### Zero hour contracts, fixed term employment, and agency contracts

• These are all acceptable where the customer has a 2 year track record in the same line of work, whether on a permanent basis, or as a contractor. For zero hour contracts we need a 2 year track record of that income type

• If the customer has not been in their current job for a year, then we can only use their income if it is consistent with the level received in their previous job

14. Debt consolidation
   Link: #debt-consolidation
============================================================

# Debt consolidation

### The maximum LTV for debt consolidation is 80%.

For top slicing, we include the monthly payments of any debts being repaid (other than Help to Buy Equity Loans) in our affordability assessment as if they were not being paid off.


15. Deposit
   Link: #deposit
============================================================

# Deposit

##### Gifted deposits

Gifted deposits (for example, money gifted by family) are acceptable. Vendor gifted deposits are only acceptable for anew build.

##### Capital from other properties

### Deposits from capital raising against other properties are acceptable.

##### New builds

For new builds, we allow cash incentives up to 5% of the purchase price without affecting the loan amount. If greater than 5%, the balance of the incentive above 5% must be deducted from the purchase price when calculating the maximum loan amount.

##### Loans

Deposits from loans are only acceptable subject to underwriter assessment. There must be no charge placed on the property we are lending on. Where the deposit is from a loan, this should be confirmed as the source of deposit in the application, and the associated expenditure and repayment terms declared. This includes loans from financial institutions or individuals, such as family members. Just so you know, we won’t usually consider scenarios where the deposit is entirely from a loan.

##### Gifted equity

### Gifted equity is acceptable when buying from a family member. See ourdiscounted purchase criteria.

##### ROSCA

Deposits sourced from Rotating Savings and Credit Associations (ROSCA), for example an open cooperative funding circle scheme, are not acceptable.

##### Evidence

We do not usually require proof of deposit to be provided. The legal rep will confirm the deposit as part of their due diligence. If the deposit is gifted, we require agifted deposit form.


16. Discounted purchase
   Link: #discounted-purchase
============================================================

# Discounted purchase

Also known as a concessionary purchase, an undervalue purchase or use of gifted equity as deposit for a purchase is acceptable when buying from a family member. The seller cannot live in the property after it has been sold.

##### How it works

The LTV will be calculated on the property value instead of the purchase price and we will not lend more than the discounted purchase price.

For example, on a property valued at £200,000 sold at a discount for £150,000, we’d lend up to £150,000 and calculate the LTV as 75%.

##### Conditions

The legal rep must establish that the family member selling the property is not insolvent and/or arrange suitable indemnity insurance for the full value of the property, and the buyer and seller must have separate legal representation.

We will need a letter from the family member(s) gifting the equity to confirm that it is a gift and they do not expect to be repaid during the recipient’s ownership of the property or on its sale.

### We do not allow a remortgage within 6 months of being gifted a property.


17. Energy Performance Certificate (EPC)
   Link: #energy-performance-certificate-epc
============================================================

# Energy Performance Certificate (EPC)

### All BTLs must have a minimum EPC rating of E.

For a new build, it can be a Predicted Energy Assessment (PEA) or a Standard Assessment Procedure calculation (SAP) rather than EPC.

### We do not usually require evidence of the rating, but we’ll let you know if we do.


18. Existing customers - additional borrowing
   Link: #existing-customers---additional-borrowing
============================================================

# Existing customers - additional borrowing

We offer additional borrowing to our existing mortgage customers who wish to release additional equity without remortgaging. If your customer is within 180 days of rate expiry or on SVR, the additional funds can be requested as part of a product transfer application. A product transfer application with additional funds can still be made outside of the 180 day product transfer window but an ERC may be applicable.

It will also be possible to vary the term and repayment type of any existing element as part of the application, subject to lending criteria.

Customers are also able to release additional equity on a separate standalone additional borrowing product when in an ERC period. This is only available to customers contacting us directly.

### Our additional borrowing has the following key features:

• Products can be selected from our existing customer product range when requested as part of a product transfer

• New business maximum LTVs apply to additional borrowing transactions

• Existing mortgage must be up to date and the application must meet current lending criteria

• Affordability will be based on total mortgage borrowing

• Maximum term is 40 years but a new additional borrowing element cannot exceed the maturity date of an existing element

• Mortgage term must exceed the end date of the selected product

• No minimum loan amount


19. Existing customers - consent to reside
   Link: #existing-customers---consent-to-reside
============================================================

# Existing customers - consent to reside

Existing BTL customers can contact us directly for permission to either move in to their BTL property or allow a close family member to reside.

Where the customer (or close family member) requests to temporarily reside in the property they can do so subject to the following conditions:

• The mortgage must be at least 12 months old

• The maximum period we can agree for consent to reside is 12 months. Customers can apply for an extension at the end of that period

• Customers who are on Interest Only/ Part and Part, who do not meet our residential interest only policy, are allowed to maintain their current repayment method

• Conversion to repayment is available for the customer at any time but they must pass residential affordability

• No further borrowing will be allowed

Where a customer wishes to permanently reside in their property they must apply for a Product Transfer to a residential product.


20. Existing customers - overpayments or lump sum payments
   Link: #existing-customers---overpayments-or-lump-sum-payments
============================================================

# Existing customers - overpayments or lump sum payments

Overpayments and/or lump sum payments are allowed in combination up to 10% of the mortgage balance during each year of the fixed rate product without incurring an early repayment charge. Fully flexible products allow unlimited overpayments / lump sum payments.

##### Overpayments

Customers can request to add a regular monthly overpayment amount to their monthly payment by contacting us. Following a product transfer or if the product is ported then the overpayment amount will be removed and will need to be set up again.

##### Lump sum payments

Lump sum payments can only be lodged once the first payment has been credited to the mortgage account.

It is important to note that your customer’s regular payment will not automatically reduce following a lump sum payment. They can request a payment reduction by contacting us.


21. Existing customers - porting
   Link: #existing-customers---porting
============================================================

# Existing customers - porting

### All our on-sale products can be ported.

Where the full balance is not ported to the new property the amount the balance has been reduced by will be subject to any applicable Early Repayment Charges.

The new mortgage can exceed the product LTV for the original application but must be within Virgin Money’s maximum loan to value limits.

Virgin Money will consider applications where customers wish to port their existing product to a property that they already own. This includes properties mortgaged to Virgin Money, another lender or owned outright.

If your customer requires additional borrowing to purchase their next property, they will be able to apply for a new product for the additional amount from the product range available at that time. Broker exclusive products can’t be used for this additional borrowing.

##### Existing customers moving home and taking an entirely new product

All customers who are moving home also have the option to take a new mortgage product from our prevailing range for the entire loan for their new property. Provided the new loan completes within three months of redemption of the existing loan, they may receive a refund of 50% on any applicable Early Repayment Charge.

##### Customers redeeming and completing on different days

If a customer doesn't complete the loan on the next property on the same day as they repay the loan on their current property, then any applicable Early Repayment Charge will be payable in full on the day of redemption. If they complete the loan on the next property within three months of redeeming, then the Early Repayment Charge will be refunded. If there is a reduction in the balance, any applicable Early Repayment Charge will be payable on the difference.

If your customer’s expected completion date on their new property is within 90 days of their product maturity, we will allow the customer to select a new product without incurring an early repayment charge, this will prevent your customer from having to port their mortgage product and then undertake a product transfer application in quick succession. If there is a reduction in the balance, any applicable Early Repayment Charge will still be payable on the difference.

Please refer to the Offer documentation issued to your customer for confirmation of their terms and conditions when moving home.

##### Procuration fees

If your customer chooses to take an entirely new mortgage product from our current range for all borrowing or transfer the remaining terms and conditions of their current product to their new property, you will be entitled to the full procuration fee for that product.

### Please refer to your club or network for details of procuration fees.

### Product switching

As part of any product transfer application, we will allow you to amend the product selected at any point before maturity. There are no restrictions on the number of times you can ‘switch’ products, however:

• If we are in the final month preceding the product transfer, we may have started the completion process, and this will have locked in the chosen rate at that time

• Any request to change rate after this will mean that your customer will have to pay an SVR payment in the month of maturity. The rate will then be amended in time for the following payment with an interest adjustment applied

### We do not lend on multi unit freehold blocks.

A MUFB is a property split into two or more self-contained flats (no shared kitchen, bathroom, etc), each let on a single tenancy agreement with its own utilities. These properties are often houses which have been converted into flats, but the building has been left on a single freehold title without the creation of individual leases for each flat. A lender’s security would usually be the freehold title upon which they would place a single mortgage.

If the flats were on individual leasehold titles then we could lend, and would require separate mortgage applications per flat.

For new build properties we can extend offers for a further 210 days and will require up to date documentation, a new on sale product to be selected and re-assessment against current criteria.

56. Rental cover
   Link: #rental-cover
============================================================

# Rental cover

### We have two types of BTL assessment, rental cover and top slicing.

Under a rental cover assessment, the rental income must cover the mortgage payment by a minimum ICR (Interest Cover Ratio) based on the relevant Stress Rate

This is the assessment we use for all portfolio landlords, and we use it for non-portfolio landlord cases unless top slicing could help.

📊 📊 Table: ICR, Remortgage with no additional borrowing, Purchase or remortgage with additional borrowing

• ICR: Basic rate taxpayers
  • Remortgage with no additional borrowing: 125%
  • Purchase or remortgage with additional borrowing: 125%

### Stress Rate

📊 📊 Table: Stress Rate, Remortgage with no additional borrowing, Purchase or remortgage with additional borrowing

• Stress Rate: Basic rate taxpayers
  • Remortgage with no additional borrowing: Higher or additional rate taxpayers
  • Purchase or remortgage with additional borrowing: All tax bands

• Stress Rate: <5 year fixed or variable rate
  • Remortgage with no additional borrowing: The higher of 5% or pay rate + 1%
  • Purchase or remortgage with additional borrowing: The higher of 5.5% or pay rate + 2%

These apply to the property being mortgaged. You might also want to check our criteria onBackground BTLs

### Tax band calculation

### We will determine the applicable tax band.

We will use 75% of all rental income, including the application being placed with us, and 100% of all other income.

### For self-employed customers it's the most recent year's figures we'll use.

### The ICR is based on the income of the highest earning applicant.

The basic rate tax ICR applies where no applicant has an income higher than the basic rate (intermediate rate in Scotland).

The higher or additional rate ICR applies where any applicant’s income is subject to higher or additional rate tax (higher, additional or top rate in Scotland).

### We have no minimum personal income requirement for mortgages which pass our stressed ICRs.

Proof of income will be required if using a 125% ICR for a purchase or remortgage with additional borrowing, and for all top slicing applications.

##### Top slicing

Top slicing uses a customer’s spare personal income to boost their borrowing amount, by allowing a lower ICR than we may otherwise allow.

We consider top slicing for non-portfolio landlords up to 75% LTV where the term finishes before the 76th birthday.

Top slicing requires a minimum combined personal income of £50,000 (excluding income received from BTL properties).

Top slicing using personal income can be considered if rental income meets a minimum of 100% at the higher of 5.5% or pay rate + 2%.

##### Affordability calculator

### Ouraffordability calculatorwill let you know how much we could lend.

It will first look at whether we could lend the amount requested using our stressed ICR rental cover assessment.

If we can’t get to the amount you need but our top slicing assessment might help, it will then ask for personal income details.

We will allow the product to be transferred to the new application. If the old case has already been cancelled, the product can still be transferred up to 6 weeks after cancellation.

##### Changing an existing offer

We can usually make changes to existing offers if you need to amend things like the term, loan amount, repayment method, or purchase price. Just contact us to let us know what you need to change. Where this requires a change to product, the range used should be our current new business range.

We allow a change of product using the current product range as many times as needed prior to completion. This can be pre-offer or post-offer, up until we have received the Certificate of Title from the solicitor. We can’t make changes to the product after the COT has been received.

• In Northern Ireland the contract should be an unprotected private tenancy agreement - not a protected or statutory tenancy under the Private Tenancies (NI) Order 2006

• In Scotland the contract should be a Short Assured Tenancy under the Housing (Scotland) Act 1988 or a Private Residential Tenancy

• In Wales the contract should be a Standard Contract

• Properties which aren’t let on one of the above contract types, including short term holiday style lets, are not accepted

• We don’t allow premium leases (where a lump sum is paid for the grant of a lease rather than as rent due), or sale and leaseback (where the property has been sold by someone who becomes its tenant)

64. Top Slicing

============================================================

# Top Slicing

Top slicing uses a customer’s spare personal income to boost their borrowing amount, by allowing a lower ICR than we may otherwise allow.

We consider top slicing for non-portfolio landlords up to 75% LTV where the term finishes before the 76th birthday.

Top slicing requires a minimum combined personal income of £50,000 (excluding income received from BTL properties).

Top slicing using personal income can be considered if rental income meets a minimum of 100% at the higher of 5.5% or pay rate + 2%.

##### Affordability calculator

### Ouraffordability calculatorwill let you know how much we could lend.

It will first look at whether we could lend the amount requested using our stressed ICR rental cover assessment.

If we can’t get to the amount you need but our top slicing assessment might help, it will then ask for personal income details.

# Valuation fees

##### Valuation report

The only valuation type available is a lender’s valuation report which is for Virgin Money to calculate how much we can lend. This may involve a physical inspection of the property or be completed remotely without visiting the property. The customer may want to separately instruct a firm of their choosing to carry out a valuation or survey.

##### Fees

The fees below include VAT and an administration fee. The cost to Virgin Money may differ from the fee charged. Our product details will make clear if a free valuation applies.

We may also charge a reinspection fee of £56 where a valuation expires and needs to be updated or where work has been carried out and the valuation needs to be updated.
