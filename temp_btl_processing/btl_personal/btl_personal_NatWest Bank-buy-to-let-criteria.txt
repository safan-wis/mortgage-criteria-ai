We will need to see a valid EPC on the EPC registers, see-The England, Wales & Northern Ireland RegisterorThe Scotland Register.Properties subject to a Selective Licensing Scheme can be considered subject to valuer’s comments on their own merits.

If the customer is unsure they should contactHMRC.

### Let to Buy Applications

We can accept Let to Buy applications and our standard BTL criteria applies.Note - Changing from a residential to a BTL is not considered like-for-like.Please key this as ‘Remortgage with additional borrowing’ on our calculator.Please see our guidance underKeying the application.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### Consumer Buy to Let

Our approach to identifying a consumer Buy to Let is based on how the customer views their Buy to Let activity. Where the customer intends to benefit from house price growth or rental income we will class this as Investment purposes and not a consumer BTL.We don’t offer consumer BTL mortgages.Sourcing Tip - If property will be used as an investment property, ensure that sourcing isn’t filtered by Consumer Buy to Let so that NatWest appears on your sourcing.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### Tax banding (3)

A regulated BTL is where the property will be rented out to an immediate family member.Wedon’tcurrently support regulated Buy to Let.
