### Using the system

How to amend your submitted application
After a full application has been submitted, it’s not possible to make amendments to the case via TMW Online. Once the case has been assigned an Application ID and you wish to make a material change, please email tmw.applications@themortgageworks.co.uk to request any changes.
How to change a product
If the full application hasn’t been fully submitted, it’s possible to resubmit the DIP and select an alternative product.
If the application has been submitted, please contact the updates team by emailing tmw.applications@themortgageworks.co.uk .
For like for like port applications, you may be asked to select a new product if the requested total loan amount is higher than the existing loan amount entered. You'll need to revisit the loan requirements.
How to print case documentation
For a submitted mortgage application:
- Search for the case you require from the TMW Online home page and click 'Open case' which will open the case tracking screen.
- All documentation generated for the case will be available on the case tracking screen.
Click on the relevant document to open and print.
For mortgage applications that have not yet been submitted, you can access documentation via the Documents link on the DIP and full mortgage application screens.
Our Contact us page has all the information you need if you have a pre or post application query.
Reserving a product
To reserve a product, you will need to complete and submit the full mortgage application paying any applicable fees for the product selected.
How can I access my colleague’s case?
You'll be unable to access the case online, however you can obtain further updates on the case by contacting the updates team on 0345 605 40 40 , then press option 2.
Non Standard Tenancy Agreement
The standard form of letting agreement we accept is an Assured Shorthold Tenancy, or either a Short Assured Tenancy, Occupation Contract in Wales or a Private Residential Tenancy in Scotland. Where this isn’t used, we’ll consider this a non standard tenancy.
We accept the following tenant types on a non standard tenancy basis:
- Corporate Tenancy – A company is the tenant for the purposes of housing one of its employees and associated family. The tenant company must employ a minimum of 1,000 people and we won’t consider any sub-letting arrangements.
- Local Authority/Housing Association Tenancy
- A private tenant where the rent is greater than £100,000 and therefore falls outside the limits of an Assured Shorthold Tenancy.
In line with standard tenancy agreements, the solicitor is responsible for checking the terms of the tenancy are acceptable to us, based on our lender information displayed in the UK Finance Handbook. The maximum term of 36 months also applies (except in the case of a Private Residential Tenancy which does not have a fixed term).
My client has lived at multiple addresses in the last 3 years. Can I submit their case online?
You can provide up to 9 previous addresses for your client, although additional information may be required in some cases.
If you get an error message
If you get an error message when keying a Let to Buy application this is most likely caused by trying to submit Let to Buy applications as a purchase.
Please check the application has been submitted as a remortgage. If you’re still receiving an error message, please contact us using .

### Packaging support case requirements

You need to submit your client's case requirements after you've received our confirmation email at the Full Mortgage Application (FMA) stage. You can upload these to TMW Online using our scan and attach facility - you don't need to email or post supporting documents.
Once the full mortgage application has been submitted, you can find a list of case requirements on the 'valuation and assessment' section within the case tracking screen.
The case requirements will be confirmed to you within your DIP response and also when you submit the full mortgage application.
We’ll only ask for additional information for complex cases where it’s necessary for us to make a decision.
If your client needs to provide case requirements you've already submitted, you can tell us the FMA reference number for the case requirements you’ve already sent and we’ll match them up. Alternatively you can resend these quoting the new Full Mortgage Application (FMA) reference number.
Back to top

### Producing a Mortgage Illustration

You must have created a case before producing a Mortgage Illustration.
You'll be given the option of creating a Mortgage Illustration once a case has been created, and again as part of the product section of the full mortgage application. Once generated, Mortgage Illustrations are saved to the case which can be accessed via the Documents link throughout DIP and full mortgage application.
When the full mortgage application has been submitted, you'll also be able to view the Mortgage Illustration via case tracking.
Back to top

### 

For a TMW online case, you'll be able to retrieve your DIP certificate directly from the DIP response screen. If you wish to access the DIP certificate after this point, it'll be available via the Documents link throughout the full mortgage application. When the full mortgage application has been submitted, you'll also be able to view the certificate via case tracking.
Amending a DIP
You can amend details on the DIP (excluding applicant personal details), at any time prior to submission of the full application. This can be done by clicking 'Amend DIP' from the DIP response screen or 'Back to DIP' at any point during the full mortgage application. Rather than submitting another DIP, you can amend the existing DIP by following the steps in the 'how can I amend a DIP' question.
If you amend details on the DIP, you will lose your current DIP decision status and will need to re-run through the DIP pages, amend and resubmit.
Once you've done this and received an 'accept', the new DIP certificate can be viewed within the Documents link throughout the full mortgage application. When the full mortgage application has been submitted, you'll also be able to view the certificate via case tracking.
Another footprint won't be left with the Credit Reference Agency / Bureau if it's within 60 days of the original DIP.
If you need to speak to us, you either call our Mortgage New Business Team on 0345 605 40 40 then press option 2 or 3 or email dip@themortgageworks.co.uk .
Back to top

### Credit Reference Agencies/Bureaus

For the assessment of lending risk, we use the three major UK credit reference agencies and bureaus:
- Equifax
- TransUnion
- Experian
We’ll search at least one agency for an application. If we require additional information or don’t get an exact match we’ll search the other agencies.
All lenders are required to leave a footprint highlighting when they've performed a search connected with mortgage lending. If we have to use more than one Credit Reference Agency or Bureau, we're required to leave a footprint at each agency used.
Please note: The Mortgage Works will only carry out searches which leave a hard footprint .

# Porting guidance and criteria

Porting is paying off an existing mortgage and taking out a new one with the same terms on a new property. This allows your client to keep their current interest rate and related product features.

## Important things to know

Porting applications are a little different to our other applications.
- Make porting applications through TMW Online (opens in a new window).
- We assess the application and affordability for porting on a Full Mortgage Application (FMA). TMW Online will not produce a Decision in Principle (DIP) for porting.
- If you need a Mortgage Illustration for porting, you can request one using our Manual Mortgage Illustration Request Form .
- For Limited Company porting, you can get a Mortgage Illustration from your sourcing system.
- The new mortgage must complete at the same time as the existing one.
- The mortgage product can port to another property in your client's buy to let portfolio, or to a new buy to let property.
- The mortgage product cannot port to a property your client or an immediate family member is currently living in.
- The property must be in a lettable condition.
- Free legal fees, cashback, and free valuation features are not portable.

## Types of porting


### Additional borrowing

When porting, your client can borrow more than the outstanding amount on the mortgage they are redeeming. However, the ported interest rate doesn't apply to the full amount they are borrowing. It will only apply up to their original loan to value (LTV) or loan amount, whichever is lower.
For any borrowing above that amount, your client will need to choose a new product from our latest guide. They will also need to pay the new product’s fees. The maximum LTV on the overall loan across both products is based on the LTV limit of the new product.
Your client won’t have to pay ERCs when they port the full balance of their existing mortgage to a new property.
Additional borrowing is subject to criteria including:
- interest cover ratio (ICR)
- current stress rates
- maximum product LTVs
There are three steps and you will need a calculator.
Step one – calculate minimum income required
You will need:
- the current balance of the mortgage product that your client wants to port
- our stress rates
- the ICR relevant to your client
Current mortgage balance x Stress rate x ICR = Minimum rental income required
Step two – calculate spare rent
You will need:
- the annual rental income of the property your client wants to port their mortgage to
- Minimum rental income required from step one
Annual rental income - Minimum rental income required = Spare rent
Step three – calculate maximum additional borrowing
You will need:
- spare rent from step two
- our stress rates
- the ICR relevant to your client
Spare rent ÷ Stress rate ÷ ICR = Maximum additional borrowing
Example:
Current mortgage balance £100,000 x stress rate 4.5% x ICR 125% = Minimum rental income required £5,625
Annual rental income £10,000 - Minimum rental income required £5,625 = Spare rent £4,375
Spare rent £4,375 ÷ stress rate 4.5% ÷ ICR 125% = Maximum additional borrowing £77,777.78
- If your client is adding the product fee for the additional borrowing to the loan amount, you will need to take this into account and reduce the maximum additional borrowing amount in the calculations above.
- If the stress rate on the additional borrowing product is higher than the stress rate on the ported mortgage, we will use the higher stress rate for both parts of the loan.
- The stress rate used for the ported mortgage will be based on the amount of time remaining on the original product.
Information:
The above calculations are provided for illustrative purposes only and the mortgage application will be subject to underwriting.

### Like for like porting

If your client is porting the total outstanding amount of the original mortgage product with us, this is a like-for-like port. Your client can keep their original product LTV, up to 80%.
For example, if your client owes £100,000 on the existing property, they must borrow £100,000 on the new mortgage product for the new property to be considered like for like.
Your client won’t have to pay ERCs when they port the full balance of their existing mortgage to a new property.

### Part redemption

If your client wants to borrow less than the outstanding amount on their existing mortgage, the difference must be repaid on completion of the new loan, and ERCs may apply to this amount. They can borrow up to the original product LTV.
For example, if your client owes £100,000 on the existing property and they want to borrow £80,000 on the new mortgage product for the new property, they will need to pay ERCs on £20,000.
Tip:
As part of any porting application, you can change the mortgage term or repayment type. You can also arrange a transfer of equity by adding or removing a party from the mortgage.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Further advances

If your client already has a Buy to Let mortgage with The Mortgage Works and wants to borrow more, they could borrow up to 80% of the value of their property (including their current mortgage), for any reason except to raise money for business purposes.
You can submit a Further Advance application on your client(s) Limited Company account. Make sure to also check our Limited Company criteria .
Please use our further advance calculator to calculate your client's maximum further borrowing.
- All BTL further advance products come with a free standard valuation.
- Dedicated Green Further advance products to support landlords in improving the energy efficiency of their property.
- Typically, your client won’t need to provide proof of identification, proof of address or proof of deposit.
- We pay procuration fees on all further advances, and you can also receive an additional procuration fee for switching your client's existing mortgage.
Use our product finder to search for the best deals we can offer your client.
Your client can borrow more for:
- Home improvements (to the security address or another property)
- Green home improvements (to the security address)
- Debt consolidation
- Purchase of new property
- Purchase of land
- Transfer of equity (this can’t be completed at the same time as a further advance application).
If your client is over the age of 70 and the LTV is over 65%, we’ll only consider applications for essential/structural repairs to the security.
Making energy efficiency improvements
If your client would like to borrow more money to improve their property’s energy efficiency, a Green Further Advance mortgage will give them a lower initial interest rate than our standard Further Advance mortgages.
Read more about Green Further Advances
To be eligible for a further advance, your client must :
- Be a Buy to Let customer
- Have owned and let the security property for at least six months
- Have been making full monthly payments on their mortgage for at least six months
- Not have been in arrears during the last 12 months, and no more than two months in arrears
- Intend to borrow at least £2,500
- Have an EPC rating between A-C for an LTV between 75.01% and 80%
We won’t accept further advance applications in the following circumstances:
- If your client has a product switch application in progress (further advance applications will be reviewed after the switch is completed)
- Capital raising for business purposes (if you're unsure, please contact to discuss prior to submission)
- Applications with more than two clients
- Where a further advance and change of borrower (also known as a transfer of equity) have been requested at the same time, either transaction must have completed before applying for the other. Please note that both a change of borrower (transfer of equity) request and further advance application will be assessed based on the relevant criteria at the time of submission.
- Regulated Buy to Let applications
- Where the requested further advance term exceeds the longest term on any existing mortgage accounts linked to the property.  If the term exceeds this, we’ll reduce it to the closest whole year to the main loan.
- If the existing mortgage term has less than 5 years remaining. The existing term will need to be extended to 5 years or more prior to submission of the further advance application.
Affordability assessment
To ensure your client can cover the additional monthly mortgage interest payment, we’ll stress the existing loan based on the term and the overall LTV.
See more information on our rental checks .
Applications for further advances are submitted to Full Mortgage Application through TMW Online.
There’s no DIP produced, as the decision is made once the application is received and assessed (including a new valuation and a credit search). Further advance applications are valid for six months from the date of the first offer.
If you wish to provide your client with a Mortgage Illustration, you can request one using our Manual Mortgage Illustration request form .
For more information on the fees your client may have to pay, view our Tariff of Charges .
If your client is looking to complete a rate switch and a further advance, these are two separate applications and you 'll need to decide which to do first.
If you complete a rate switch application first, we're unable to guarantee that a further advance application will be accepted subsequently.
Completing a further advance first may mean that any subsequent rate switch could be charged at a higher rate due to the increased LTV.  The further advance will need to have completed prior to a rate switch application.
If your clients have started a further advance application but don’t want to continue with this as they would rather proceed with a Rate Switch, we’ll require instructions from your clients to cancel the application. This can be included with the paper application form for the product switch.
You can email a copy of the completed Further Advance Release form to tmw-completions@themortgageworks.co.uk . To avoid delays in your completion, please ensure the subject field of the email includes the case reference number. And that is states one of the below:
- COT
- Certificate of title
- Report on title
- Release of funds form
We'll require five working days notice when submitting a further advance release. We'll release the funds on:
- the same day as completion if you select a working day
- the next working day if you select Sunday or a Bank Holiday
- the Friday before if you select a Saturday.
All applicants on the offer must sign a 'Further Advance release request'. The bank details on the release form should match the Direct Debit details held on the main loan. An offer is valid for 6 Months, so completion should be within this time. We may be able to offer a short extension if needed. We'll need to check there are no arrears on the main loan before we can release the funds. You'll need to ensure you have fulfilled any special conditions before requesting any further advance funds.
Where a solicitor is acting in the transaction, we can release the advance to the solicitor.
If you or the solicitor emails us requesting funds release, please ensure the subject line includes our 8 digit reference number and the words, ‘Funds release form’.
Failure to include this information may delay completion.

# Understanding affordability

Your client may be able to borrow more than you think.
We calculate affordability based on the interest cover ratio (ICR) and stress rate.
Our ICRs may be higher than some on the market. But differences in our stress rates (reduced for like for like Remortgage and 5 year fixed products) mean we may be able to lend your clients more than other lenders.
Here’s an example of how we compare where your client has a monthly rent of £1,000 and has chosen a 5 Year Fixed Rate product with a rate of 4.50% :
Stress rate: 4.50%
ICR: 160%
Maximum loan: £166,666

### New Build criteria and case support

We're aware of the importance of obtaining a quick offer on a New Build application, so here are some Top Tips
- The valuer must have access to the UK Finance Disclosure Form in order to value the property.  Please make sure this is available when they visit the property/site.
- When completing an initial Decision In Principle (DIP), please review the maximum loan to value (LTV). We won't ask you if the property is a New Build at this stage of the application.
- Please ensure you provide proofs as soon as you can as we may request additional proofs. This will enable us to complete the underwriting on the case quicker.
Our New Build loan to values (LTVs) differ to our standard LTVs.
New Build houses: 80% LTV
New Build flats: 75% LTV
*You must check the relevant LTV and maximum loan size based on the type of application. The lowest LTV will apply.
Acceptable application types for New Build applications are:
- Standard Buy to Let
- First Time Landlords
- Portfolio
- Limited Company
- Houses in Multiple Occupation.
The value of all incentives must be declared on the UK Finance Disclosure Form (opens in a new window) and the current version of the form must be used.
Standard purchase cases
- Builder deposits, cashback and any other financial incentives (including vouchers) listed in Section 7 of the UK Finance Disclosure Form are acceptable, up to a maximum total value of 5% of the purchase price or valuation. If the total value is more than 5% we'll decline the case. The value of incentives will need to be reduced to 5% or lower.
Vendor cashback
- We'll treat as Vendor Cashback where cashback on properties have recently been (or are in the process of being) upgraded or converted into flats by a developer. Except if they're developing several properties on several sites at the same time.
- We deduct the value of the Vendor Cashback from the purchase price or valuation*, which gives the net purchase price. We base our lending on whichever is lower, the net purchase price or net value.
*whichever is lower
All mortgage offers are valid for 6 months from the date of the first offer.
However, for New Build we’ll consider extending this by 45 days, subject to eligibility.
If there are 30 days or less until their mortgage offer expires, you can request an extension by emailing us at TMW.Applications@themortgageworks.co.uk . You'll need to provide details of the account number, customer name and confirmation that there have been no material changes to the application.
To help us process your request, please submit your request no later than 15 days before the offer is due to expire. Please complete a new application if you know your client will be unable to complete within the extended offer period. No further extensions will be available.
You can submit New Build applications via TMW Online (opens in a new window).
If new, or built within five years, the security must have a warranty guarantee. The Building warranties we'll accept include:
- NHBC
- LABC
- Build-zone
- Premier Guarantee

* PCCs are acceptable for newly built homes within a development of no more than 10 units. A maximum of 4 units within the structure where they're within a continuous structure. For example, a row of terrace houses or block of flats. We'll require a PCC for newly converted or homes which have recently been significantly altered or refurbished. Retrospective certificates by a professional who has not supervised the project from the start and inspected the build at regular intervals are not acceptable.
** The Mortgage Works will only accept a CRL New Build 10 year structural defects insurance policy in the following circumstances:
- The final certificate is dated 04/09/2019 or earlier, and the underwriter is International General Insurance Company (UK) Ltd (IGI) or CGICE

### Licensing

Depending on the location and type of rental, private rented properties may need different types of licensing.
The licence applies to both the owner (or the owner’s agent) and each property. The new owner must apply for a new licence when they purchase a property.

#### Types of licence

Selective licence
A local authority may require selective licensing for all private rented property in a specific area, of any type.
Additional licence
A local authority may require additional licensing for specific property or rental types in a given area.
HMO licence
Under the Housing Act 2004 (opens in a new window) , all large HMOs in England and Wales must be licensed. A large HMO is:
- 3 or more storeys
- occupied by 5 or more persons
- forming at least 2 separate households
See our HMO criteria page for full details of how we treat these applications.

#### Licensed property criteria

We'll lend on licensed properties if they meet the following criteria:
- Remortgage and further advance : A relevant current licence must be in place.  There may be some circumstances where proof that a licence has been applied for are acceptable.
- Remortgage converting a residential property to a buy to let : Proof that the relevant licence has been applied for
- Purchase and Let to Buy : Proof that the relevant licence has been applied for.
If a landlord has a licence, but it’s not the right licence for their use of the property, we'll decline.
Sometimes selective or additional licensing applies to a small HMO, also known as a C4. We don't treat these applications as HMOs unless they meet our definition of HMO .

#### Valuations

If our valuer believes the property doesn't meet the requirements for licensing or breaches licensing requirements, they'll decline, even if the landlord already has a licence.
See our Valuations page for more details on appeals.

### Change of security address

For changes to the security address during the application process, a new application will need to be submitted. Products and criteria at time of re-submission will apply.

### Portability

Accepted. Applies when applicant simultaneously completes a mortgage for the same or greater amount keeping the same interest rate for that portion of the new mortgage without incurring an early repayment charge. Subject to meeting the company's lending criteria at the time of application.

### Sale and rent back

It is not permitted for the vendor to remain as a tenant in the property or to retain an interest in the property.

### Property Investment Clubs / Companies

Applications to purchase properties sourced via Property Investment Clubs/Companies are not accepted. These are typically businesses which offer to buy a property quickly from a seller, and then sells it on to another buyer.

### Property

All Buy to Let properties must be used for residential purposes only and be in a lettable condition, to be determined by the valuer.

### Properties not owned in personal name(s)

### Second charge

A second charge is a second mortgage secured on your client's property with another lender. A second charge is secondary to their main loan so when the property is sold, the main lender will be repaid first. The main lender will need to give their permission before they take a second charge.
New applications with existing second charges are not accepted (unless repaid as part of the transaction). Consent to second charges post-completion considered on a strict case by case basis.
This will be subject to criteria and affordability at the time of application, including rental cover assessment and LTV limits (currently the LTV can't exceed 50% LTV before adding second charge) and the purpose must be for home improvements only.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Income criteria


## In this section we cover:

- Interest Cover Ratio (ICR)
- Stress rates
- Minimum income
- Income proofs
- Adverse Credit
- Top Slicing

### Interest Cover Ratio (ICR)

To reflect the different taxable income levels of applicants, we have a range of ICRs that are applicable dependant on the customer and/or application. The gross rental income, confirmed by the valuer, must cover the monthly mortgage interest payment by at least:
Buy to Let and Let to Buy: HMO and Limited Company HMO
Lower rate tax: Higher rate tax
125%: 160%
When calculating the maximum borrowing, this will include any product fees you want to add to the loan. If the product fee is being added to the loan, this can exceed the maximum LTV. But it can't exceed the maximum loan amount.
125% ICR applies to all Limited Company applications (except Houses in Multiple Occupation). And those in personal names where the following criteria is met:
- Applicants declare themselves to be Lower rate taxpayers and;
- Declaring their gross annual income is less than £50,271 per applicant, upon completion of the mortgage. This is less than £43,662 gross income in Scotland.
- Personal applicants can have no more than 3 rental properties (with or without a mortgage). This includes any The Mortgage Works applications in progress.
Of the existing buy to let income input at Decision in principle stage, we'll take into account the following in our assessment of an applicant’s overall income:
- 75% of all rental income. This includes existing and proposed buy to lets with The Mortgage Works.
- 100% of all other sources of income.
Read our ' Understanding affordability' page on how we calculate affordability and how much your client could borrow.

### Additional ICR information

In order to ensure the correct ICR is applied to the application, you need to key 100% of all existing BTL income.
For purchase and Let to Buy applications we'll add 75% of the new property's proposed gross rental income to the applicants’ annual income.
For joint applications, we'll add half of the 75% proposed gross rental income to each applicants’ annual income.
We'll treat any applicant that has recently left employment, retired or started self-employment as a higher rate taxpayer.
View our Portfolio landlord criteria page to see the rental calculations and maximum LTVs for portfolio landlords.

### Stress rates

To check affordability, we apply the following stress rates:
Trackers and variables: Higher of pay rate +2% or 5.50%
Fixed for 1 or 2 years Like for Like Remortgage (excluding Let to Buy): Higher of pay rate or 4.50%
* Please refer to our ICR section for more information on the ICR applicable on your application.

#### Pay rates

Check our product finder to find out what the pay rate is for your product.

#### Further advances

We'll continue to stress individual loan elements separately in line with the above. However, the Stress Rate applied to existing lending will be set to a minimum of the Stress Rate applicable to the new borrowing. Please download our further advance calculator for support calculating potential further borrowing.

### Minimum income

There is no minimum personal income requirement. Proof of personal income may be requested to support an application. We'll use this with other information relating to the landlord and the property. This is to validate that the loan is going to be used for its intended purpose.

#### Non-portfolio applications

We'll carry out further underwriting. We may require additional proofs to support sustainability by requesting one or more of the following evidence:
- 3 months' bank statements
- Personal savings to support 6 months’ rental income
- Additional household income*
- Available household funds to act as a sinking fund.*
* We'll only consider household income/sinking fund where the third party is a spouse/ partner of the applicant. They'll need to hold a joint residential mortgage with them.
We may decline the application if we consider the exposure to be too high. For example, where they have a large residential mortgage solely owned. Or a large amount of unsecured debt not consistent with the household income.

### Income proofs

We'll require income proofs for landlords using the 125% ICR. We may request proofs for applications with a 160% ICR or higher. For example if there are high levels of unsecured debt, Nationwide Group BTL exposure over £1million.
Income included in assessment:
- Gross earned income (employed/ self employed)
- Pension income
- Total gross rental income
Acceptable proof of income:
Experienced Landlord: Self employed
First Time Landlord: Self employed
Employed/retired: Latest payslip/pension statement
No taxable income: 3 months bank statement

### Adverse Credit

Where there is adverse credit, we apply a range of factors to determine how we assess applications.
- In general we won't accept applicants who have had in the last six years:
- an Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA)
- a property subject to a previous repossession
- a County Court Judgement (CCJ) / Court Decree registered against them
- discharged bankruptcies (we'll consider after 6 years)
- We also won't consider lending to applicants with:
- a Bankruptcy Restriction Order or Bankruptcy restriction undertaking in place
- if applicants are in mortgage arrears . However, we can consider minor historic arrears by exception.
- current or previous defaults . However, we can consider strong applications by exception.
- an Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA)

### Before you apply

You can apply for Limited Company products through TMW Online (opens in a new window) . For a newly created Limited Company, please wait 3 days before applying for any products.
You can't obtain a Decision in Principle (DIP) through TMW Online. You should obtain Mortgage Illustrations from your usual sourcing system.

#### Companies House pre-application check

Before you apply, we’ll validate SPV information on Companies House to ensure it matches. There can be examples where you get a decline message related to Unacceptable Person of Significant Control.
This could be due to:
- A difference between Director or Shareholder details and Person of Significant Control (PSC) on Companies House.
- A PSC that is not an applicant.
- The Officer and PSC name match on Companies House but the Shareholder names are not correct.
To correct this, please do the following:
- Check the filing history and any confirmation statements to see if the Shareholder details have been updated. If they have, they will show the names of the current Shareholders for you to compare to.
- If the Shareholder names do not show, check the document labelled 'Incorporation' and this will detail the Shareholder structure when the Limited Company was created. Open this document and go to the Initial Shareholdings section and check that the Shareholder names and addresses match.
- If the names do not match, the shareholding information on Companies House will need to be updated.
- It takes 3 days for Companies House updates to show on our records, so please wait to reapply.
- If all names match and there are no differences, please email dip@themortgageworks.co.uk who will review and add a decline appeal to your case to enable you to continue.
If our interest rates change before the update of the Companies House information, we may be able to honour the original rate you were looking to apply for. This is only if there’s a discrepancy in the spelling or special characters of the Directors, Shareholders or Company name.
Once Companies House has been updated, you should submit a new application on one of the updated rates. This must be within 7 working days of the original application . Then email dip@themortgageworks.co.uk quoting both the new and the original reference number . You'll need to include details of the original product you were looking to apply for.
TMW Online updates every 10 minutes, so you can get an up-to-date case update online.

### Company restrictions

If your client is planning to make changes to the directors or shareholding of their company, they must let us know directly in advance.
If the company changes have already been made, your client will need to re-instate the structure we originally agreed to, or redeem their mortgage.
You must apply for our consent to make any company changes. All applications are subject to a risk assessment.
Please complete and ask your client to sign our Change of Director/Shareholder form . You can then post the completed form, along with the required identification to:
The Mortgage Works Northampton Administration Centre Kings Park Road Moulton Park Northampton, NN3 6NW
If we approve your request, you will need to pay a ‘change of parties fee’. See Our fees and charges for details.

### Unacceptable company changes

### Additional information

- For new applications, we'll be paying an additional 0.10% gross procuration fee for Limited Company cases. This will be payable via your usual Mortgage Club or Network.
- If your clients are both directors of the company however only one has a shareholding, then 100% of the shareholding must be owned by the directors to be acceptable to The Mortgage Works.
- We aren’t insisting on separate solicitor representation for you and your client.
- We'll accept an SPV Limited Company which is set up solely for the purpose of buying, letting and selling residential BTL property. If the Limited Company trades in additional industries, this is not acceptable.
- Only the director of the SPV will have account access with decision making responsibilities. For example completing a rate switch or amending the term or repayment method.
- The SIC code of a company confirms the nature of trading. The Mortgage Works will accept any/all of the SIC codes 68100, 68201, 68209 and 68320.
- We won't accept Layered companies. A layered company is where another company has a shareholding in the proposed company, or where the proposed company has a shareholding in another company.

# Portfolio landlord criteria


## In this section we cover:

- The Mortgage Works portfolio landlord definition
- Affordability assessment
- Keying applications in TMW Online
- Packaging applications (including Portfolio Portal)
- Useful tools, guides and forms
- We're here to help

### The Mortgage Works portfolio landlord definition

A portfolio landlord is a borrower with four or more distinct mortgaged Buy to Let UK rental properties. Or seven or more for remortgage applications without capital raising.
This includes:
- properties owned through a limited company
- consent to let properties
- and all BTL mortgages owned solely or jointly by the applicant(s).

#### Additional information

We won't consider foreign properties when assessing portfolio landlords.
If there are two applicants, we’ll use the combined number of rental properties for both. For example, if the first applicant solely owns three mortgaged properties and the second applicant solely owns five properties, they would collectively own eight properties in the portfolio.

### Affordability assessment

All new mortgage applications with The Mortgage Works are assessed to ensure your client can cover their monthly mortgage interest payment.
We'll also assess the existing portfolio to ensure the overall aggregate LTV and ICR is sustainable. The assessment will be based on the entire portfolio, including the new property and any rental properties without a mortgage.
We have different products depending on the size of your client's portfolio, so please make sure to check our latest product guide prior to application.
The following rental calculations and maximum LTVs will apply across your client's portfolio:

#### Existing portfolio rental calculation

Up to 10 mortgaged BTL properties at completion: 75%

#### Portfolio checker

Use our portfolio checker to get an indication as to whether your client's portfolio is likely to fit The Mortgage Works criteria.
Portfolio checker

### Keying applications in TMW Online

- We ask for your client's personal income on all cases.
- At DIP stage, we look at gross annual buy to let income as well as the total number of properties, to identify if your client is/will be a portfolio landlord on completion of the application.
- If your client has 4 or more mortgaged properties, we'll ask for details of the total value and outstanding mortgage balances secured against the portfolio.
Please note:
- If a BTL property is jointly owned between your clients, you only need to enter them under one applicant, not both.
- If you're creating multiple applications for the same applicant(s), please try to submit them at the same time.
- If a property is owned by an applicant and a 3rd party, please key the full rental as well as the full mortgage amount.

### Packaging applications (including Portfolio Portal)

Portfolio landlords with 11 or more mortgaged BTL properties need to provide three months' current account statements showing rental payments for their portfolio
All portfolio landlords will need to provide a property schedule, either by:
- Keying the details into our Portfolio Portal (opens in a new window)
- Or completing our property schedule form and uploading into our portal*
*When uploading The Mortgage Works property schedule form directly into the portal, please don't insert new columns into this spreadsheet, copy and paste over the cells or provide any additional information we haven't requested, as this will cause upload errors.
Once submitted, the details will be automatically validated and the results will be sent to our dedicated team of underwriters for assessment. We'll be able to assess the case more quickly if you're able to complete this as soon as you've completed the application.
See our Portfolio Portal guidance notes for more information.
Depending on case complexity and portfolio size, we may request further supporting information such as a business plan.
So your case can be processed efficiently, please submit all requested proofs and additional supporting information, but only when this is asked for.

### Useful tools, guides and forms

- Portfolio checker
- Property schedule template
- Portfolio Portal guidance notes
- Personalised Portfolio Review tool

The Mortgage Works will consider its overall exposure by applicant, geographical area and development when assessing applications. These exposure limits are per applicant and the number of units include securities mortgaged to other lenders and/ or unencumbered properties. The maximum concentration that can be considered per development is:
1-3 Units: 1 Unit if a purchase application. For remortgages we can consider up to 3 flats, in a block of no more than 3 flats, providing the applicant has owned each of their flats for at least 12 months.
4-20 Units: 25%, rounded down to the nearest unit
21+ Units: Maximum of 10 in a postcode up to the first digit of the second grouping (e.g. BH2 6) Up to 5 in the exact postcode (e.g. BH2 6EP)
- For remortgages we can consider up to 3 flats, in a block of no more than 3 flats, providing the applicant has owned each of their flats for at least 12 months.

### Scheme abuse

The Mortgage Works customers aren’t allowed to live in the Buy to Let property at any time and will be in breach of the terms and conditions of the mortgage contract should they choose to do so. Where this is the case, The Mortgage Works's policy is to give the customer a period of time in which to vacate the property, or instead remortgage to a residential loan. If a customer fails to comply with these terms, this may lead to legal action being taken against them, which could ultimately result in The Mortgage Works taking possession of the property.

### Valuation criteria

- Leasehold properties must have a minimum lease of 70 years at application.
- The valuer must be satisfied that there is a market for any property taking the lease term into consideration.
- Although an application may meet the guidelines above, the property may still be declined by the valuer, e.g. a mortgage application in England for a 20 year term with a 71 year unexpired lease is within policy, but the valuer may advise the property is not readily marketable and saleable and we will therefore not consider the property as suitable security.

### Construction types

Traditional Construction
The following are regarded as traditional construction and normal lending terms apply:
Walls
- Cavity outer walls of brick/reconstituted stone/block (including rendered walls) with inner walls of brick or block.
- Timber framed property with outer walls of brick/reconstituted stone/block (including rendered walls), built 1970 or after.
- Solid stone (eg limestone, granite).
- Cob - or any regional variant (for example cobb, clom and Wychert).
Roof
- Tile (concrete)
- Slate
- Thatch (reed or straw)
- Felt, asphalt
- Copper, lead
Spray Foam Insulation
If spray foam insulation has been fitted in the wall voids of the property, then the valuer will decline the property.
Where spray foam has been installed in the rafters, frame, and/or underfloor structure, the property will initially be declined by the valuer, but can be reconsidered with evidence of either:
Confirmation the installation of the foam is in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations, and
- The full pre-survey suitability report including details of the materials/isolating card
- The condensation risk assessment
- Evidence of BBA certification
- The warranty/guarantee provided of the installation and insulation.  This warranty must be transferable upon sale of the property to the new owners.
Or
A Chartered Building Survey (FRICS or MRICS qualified) should be instructed to undertake an invasive inspection. They'll need to report on the frame integrity. Where it requires remediation or foam removal work, you will need to include an estimated cost.
Non Traditional Construction
Many properties have been built using a variety of other construction methods. Lending terms vary depending on construction types and if a repair scheme, where appropriate, has been used. Where a property is of non traditional construction please contact your usual Service Centre with the following details for further advice:
- The name of the type of construction
- Year built (if known)
- Flat/terrace/semi or detached
- Details of any repair scheme if appropriate and if the scheme applies to the whole block (e.g. the whole terrace/both semi's)
The exact construction name is important as lending terms may differ between different types and year built. For example, our lending terms differ between Gregory, Gregory Drury System 3 and Gregory Housing. All three have different lending terms and it is important to ensure you give us the  full and accurate name to avoid us giving  inappropriate advice.
Modern Methods of Construction
We're supportive of development schemes which incorporate Modern Methods of Construction (MMC), although an MMC scheme must display sufficient robustness, technical rigour and suitability for its location. Due to the wide and constantly changing range of products in the market, each development (not system) is treated independently. Please provide the information below to enable us to consider your development fully:
- Principal construction materials - e.g. steel frame, timber frame, CLT (Cross Laminated Timber)
- Details of the roof and wall finishes - please also provide confirmation/evidence of their British Board of Agrément (BBA) or similar accreditation, which should be for a minimum 30 year lifespan (to include fixings)
- Warranty details - this should be a mainstream warranty accepted by The Mortgage Works (preferably “NHBC Accepts”). We also require confirmation as to whether the system has Buildoffsite Property Assurance Scheme (BOPAS) accreditation
- Any available site specific information regarding the development .

### Purpose built flats, converted flats and studio flats

The internal floor area must be no less than 30 square metres. Studio Flats must contain a separate bathroom.
Where the property is a Studio Flat, enter '1' for number of bedrooms.
Freehold flats
In general we do not accept freehold flats or maisonettes, or where each flat in a block has its own separate freehold title. However, we will accept flats without a lease as suitable freehold security if:
- there are no more than four flats in the block (if there are five or more this will be treated as a commercial proposition and not accepted)
- the remaining flats are all subject to a minimum lease of 70 years
Coach house flats are acceptable as a freehold where there is one flat above garages or an access way.

### Property developers

- Applications where the loan purpose is to fund the development and sale of property are not acceptable.
- Where your client is a Property Developer, we will conduct an underwriting assessment to ensure that there is no risk of structural alteration or subdivision to the proposed security or that capital raised could be used to fund a development project.
- Applications that meet our remortgage policy for properties that have been built or converted by an applicant can be accepted, providing the property is fully complete and will be let on completion.

### Local Authority flats

We won’t accept former local authority flats in blocks of more than five storeys. This also applies to maisonettes and Scottish tenements in blocks of more than five storeys that were, or still are, in local authority ownership.

### Lease terms

- The acceptable minimum lease term is 70 years. If the lease term is less than this, you must confirm at application that the lease will be extended on or before completion. In this scenario, a ‘Decline’ decision will automatically be produced – we'll then send you a Decline Appeal form which must be completed and submitted together with a letter from the solicitor confirming the following;
- Confirmation the applicant(s) owns, or is intending to purchase the Freehold Title, OR
- If the applicant (or the seller as part of a purchase) is extending the remaining lease term, please provide a letter from the solicitor on letter headed paper confirming:
- Length of lease (years)
- Date of commencement of lease
- Ground rent (£ amount)
- Ground rent review frequency
- Ground rent increase methodology (e.g. RPI linked)
- Confirmation the applicant(s) owns, or is intending to purchase the Freehold Title, OR
- If the applicant (or the seller as part of a purchase) is extending the remaining lease term, please provide a letter from the solicitor on letter headed paper confirming:
- Length of lease (years)
- Date of commencement of lease
- Ground rent (£ amount)
- Ground rent review frequency
- Ground rent increase methodology (e.g. RPI linked)
- Length of lease (years)
- Date of commencement of lease
- Ground rent (£ amount)
- Ground rent review frequency
- Ground rent increase methodology (e.g. RPI linked)
We'll only allow lease extensions on new and existing lending when completed under the Leasehold Reform Act.
The valuer must be satisfied there is a market for any property, taking the lease terms into consideration.
- Please note that there are different limits for acceptable New Build lease terms – see New Build property lease terms above for details
- Where the valuer believes marketability will be impacted by the lease terms, they may reflect this in their valuation, e.g.
- Where ground rent escalation is linked to the value of the property or an index greater than The Retail Price Index (RPI)
- Where lease clauses appear onerous, e.g. disproportionate service charges or event clauses for normal use, such as installing an aerial
- Where ground rent escalation is linked to the value of the property or an index greater than The Retail Price Index (RPI)
- Where lease clauses appear onerous, e.g. disproportionate service charges or event clauses for normal use, such as installing an aerial
- Some lease terms will impact marketability so severely they will always result in the property being declined, e.g
- Where ground rent is greater than or equal to 0.5% of the property value, or where the review period is less than or equal to 5 years.
- Where ground rent doubles in less than 20 years (e.g every 5, 10 or 15 years) or escalates by compounded RPI
- Where ground rent is greater than or equal to 0.5% of the property value, or where the review period is less than or equal to 5 years.
- Where ground rent doubles in less than 20 years (e.g every 5, 10 or 15 years) or escalates by compounded RPI
These examples aren’t exhaustive, and the solicitor is expected to refer back to us any lease terms they feel may affect the value or future saleability of the security.

### Estate Charges

- Estate Rent Charges, or Estate Management Charges, can apply to freehold or leasehold properties.
- Charges must be reasonable at all times. Where charges are greater than £500 per annum, we’ll need to be advised what the charges cover so the valuer can assess whether the valuation is affected.

### Japanese Knotweed

Properties with Japanese Knotweed growing within the vicinity are considered with caution and subject to the following terms:
If Japanese Knotweed:
- is actually causing visible material damage to a structure, OR
- is not actually causing visible material damage but is still likely to prevent use of or access to amenity space, OR
- is visible on adjoining land, but is evidently unmanaged and has the potential to significantly impact the subject property/grounds
Then the applicant will be required to obtain a specialist report in respect of eradicating the plant, including an insurance backed 5 year warranty against re-appearance of the plant, and if necessary, repairs to the property and services will be required for the valuer to make a full assessment of the property's suitability.
However, if Japanese Knotweed:
- isn't actually causing visible material damage to a structure and isn't likely to prevent use of or restrict access to amenity space, OR
- is visible on adjoining land but is managed with no potential to significantly impact the subject property/grounds.
Written confirmation is required from the applicant confirming that they're aware of the presence of this invasive plant and the adverse affects it could have on the property should it spread closer. It is recommended the applicant seeks their own independent professional advice regarding the risk this plant might impose.

### Building insurance

The Mortgage Works is legally obliged to ensure that adequate insurance is obtained by your client for the property to be mortgaged. Full details may be required in the form of a policy schedule with the interest of The Mortgage Works (UK) plc noted as mortgagee. Switching mortgage products won't affect your client's house insurance.

### Post Valuation queries reports

Valuers may request specialist reports within their valuation which are:
- designed to highlight defects
- and/or to assist them in obtaining additional information upon which to base their valuation.
The valuer will advise which reports they need. A surveyor will then need to complete all the requested reports. Once completed, you'll need to upload them to the case, so we can refer them back to the valuer for their consideration. We'll only accept reports from qualified firms and professions and they must show a proper detailed inspection has been made. The initial report might certify that the property is not a suitable security. If this happens we may consider it following an independent review by a specialist.
The following are examples of specialist reports that we might request:
Structural Engineers Report: Valuers may require this specialist report to consider if a property is suitable security and if there's any required works which could impact the value. For a structural report to be acceptable it must: be dated within the last 90 days be for the whole property and have comment(s) on any specific issues which the valuer has identified be addressed to the applicant and in both names if this is a joint mortgage application. If the report is addressed to a third party (for example the person selling the property), the author of the report must confirm in writing that the applicant, lender (Nationwide) and professional advisers can rely on its contents. The report must be on appropriate letter headed paper. It must indicate that the Structural Engineer holds one of the below qualifications: Standard - MICE / FICE / AMI Struct E / MI Struct E / FI Struct E Chartered Building Surveyor - MRICS / FRICS Corporate Building/Corporate Structural Engineer - MASI / FASI / MCABE / FCABE / MCIOB / FCIOB / MIEI (Members of Engineers Ireland).
Damp and timber report: Valuers may require this specialist report to consider if a property is suitable security and if there's any required works which could impact the value. The report must be: Dated within the last 90 days For the whole property If remedial damp treatment works are required to the property, your client must have cover with a 10-year insurance backed guarantee. Any guarantee issued must be in the name of the applicants, and/or transferable to new owners.
Electrical report: We may require an electrical report if the wiring is old or the property has been extended significantly at some point in the past. An inspection will involve the testing of all electrical wiring by a qualified electrician: England & Wales - NICEIC, STORMA or NAPIT registered electricians Scotland - NICEIC registered electricians
Valuers may require this specialist report to consider if a property is suitable security and if there's any required works which could impact the value.
For a structural report to be acceptable it must:
- be dated within the last 90 days
- be for the whole property and have comment(s) on any specific issues which the valuer has identified
- be addressed to the applicant and in both names if this is a joint mortgage application. If the report is addressed to a third party (for example the person selling the property), the author of the report must confirm in writing that the applicant, lender (Nationwide) and professional advisers can rely on its contents.
The report must be on appropriate letter headed paper. It must indicate that the Structural Engineer holds one of the below qualifications:

### Fire safety assessment

The valuer will decline the property if it has:
- cladding with external wall systems and any attachment (e.g. balconies)
- non-cladding related fire safety concerns with external wall systems and any attachment (e.g. balconies)
- or any other significant fire safety concerns in a multi-storey, multi-occupancy buildings.

#### Why do we ask for more information before mortgage offer?

It’s important that you highlight and address with your client any fire safety issues with the property as soon as possible.
This means if we’re able to give them a mortgage offer, they can be more confident these issues won’t arise later in their mortgage journey. For example when they’re close to completion.

#### What happens next?

Governments of each jurisdiction have introduced different legislation and requirements to address fire safety concerns.
We’ll need some more information to decide if the property is suitable. Our requirements will depend on:
- the location (jurisdiction) of the property, (i.e. England, Wales or Scotland)
- the height of the building
- whether the property’s fire safety issues are going to be remediated and/or mitigated. Or, for example, whether they're being refuted by the Principal Accountable Person (the person responsible for repairing and reporting on common parts of the building).

#### Our requirements for cases affected by fire safety issues

We'll contact you if a Valuer has declined a property due to fire safety concerns that need to be investigated. We’ll know the jurisdiction and height of the building. However, you’ll need to know whether the property’s fire safety issues are going to be remediated and/or mitigated. For example, whether the building is being remediated under the Developer Pledge.
So we can review the property further, once you have identified the relevant remediation/mitigation route for the building, please use the guidance below, so you know what information to send us.
If a free legal fee product is selected and the valuer raises concerns about fire safety on a property, we can't proceed on a free legal fee basis. We'll contact you to let you know. A new product must be selected using solicitors from our panel.

### Our guidance

The Building Safety Act [2022] sets out clear obligations and protections in relation to high-rise multi-occupancy residential buildings. Many will have to undergo the remediation process. The protections offered under the Building Safety Act [2022] only relates to those living in high-rise blocks, defined as being 11 metres or more (or 5 storeys or more). Buildings under 11 metres (or 4 storeys or less) will have different requirements.

The Government has introduced consultation with the Housing (Cladding Remediation) (Scotland) Bill. They have also suggested amendments to the Building (Scotland) Act [2003]. This will pave the way in how impacted properties will be assessed and remediated in Scotland. These have not yet made their way into formal legislation.
Our requirements when dealing with Scottish applications
The valuer will decline the property pending receipt of an EWS1 form (PDF, 200KB - opens in a new window) . Where a valuer has cladding or non-cladding fire safety concerns with external wall systems, attachments (e.g. Balconies), or any other significant fire safety concerns.
The form must be:
- obtained from the property owner. The ‘Client organisation’ on the form must be the building owner. We won't accept it in the name of the applicant/client.
- fully completed
- accompanied by a letter of provenance on headed paper, from the signing firm which details
- their area of business
- qualifications
- confirmation that they've completed the form.
- their area of business
- qualifications
- confirmation that they've completed the form.
It's the duty of the building owner to ensure the signing firm is a member of an appropriate professional body. See the RICS website (opens in a new window) for more information.
The specialist will complete the form and select either ‘low risk’ or ‘high risk’ and will then choose a rating of either:
- A1, A2 and B1 - we’ll send the form to the valuer for assessment. If accepted, they’ll provide an amended valuation report.
- A3 or B2 - we’ll assess the case and let you know our decision. We may request confirmation from the building owner about the remedial building work required. And who’ll be liable for the cost of those works. For Scotland, we'll require confirmation from the building factors/managing agents acting for the co-proprietors.
For all application types where the building owner will cover the remedial costs, we’ll require confirmation in writing from the building owner that:
- you will compile the EWS1 requirements and render the building fire safe (i.e. fall within the definition of A1, A2 or B1) on completion of the remedial works.
- the interim fire safety measures are satisfactory.
- you will not pass on costs or hidden charges to the leaseholder (e.g. via service charges).
- remediation will take place within a reasonable timescale (12 months).
Where remedial costs fall to individual leaseholders/flat owners
For remortgage and purchase, if the building owner’s solicitors confirm in writing, we’ll consider applications where the owner has paid for and planned/started remedial works. We’ll decline any applications if remedial works have not yet been paid for or planned/started.
For further advances, we’ll consider applications if the funds are being raised to carry out the required remedial works. We'll require further information from the building owner to make an assessment, including:
- the compiled EWS1 requirements rendering the building fire safe (i.e. fall within the definition of A1, A2 or B1) on completion of the remedial works.
- confirmation the interim fire safety measures are satisfactory.
- a summary of the remedial works required and when the works will take place.
- costs the leaseholder/flat owner is liable for and when the required funds are due to be paid to the freeholder.
The valuer will decline the property pending receipt of an EWS1 form (PDF, 200KB - opens in a new window) or a Fire Risk Assessment External Walls report. Where a valuer has cladding or non-cladding fire safety concerns with external wall systems, attachments (e.g. Balconies), or any other significant fire safety concerns.
The EWS1 form must be:
- obtained from the building owner (property owner in Scotland). The ‘Client organisation’ on the form must be the building owner. We won't accept it in the name of the applicant/client.
- fully completed and accompanied by a headed paper letter from the signing firm which details
- their area of business
- qualifications
- confirmation that they've completed the form.
- their area of business
- qualifications
- confirmation that they've completed the form.
It's the duty of the building owner to ensure the signing firm is a member of an appropriate professional body. See the RICS website (opens in a new window) for more information.
The specialist will complete the form and select either ‘low risk’ or ‘high risk’ and will then choose a rating of either:
- A1, A2 and B1 - we’ll send the form to the valuer for assessment. If accepted, they’ll provide an amended valuation report.
- A3 or B2 - we’ll assess the case and let you know our decision. We may request confirmation from the building owner about the remedial building work required. And who’ll be liable for the cost of those works. For Scotland, we'll require confirmation from the building factors/managing agents acting for the co-proprietors.
For all application types where the building owner will cover the remedial costs, we’ll require confirmation in writing from the building owner that:
- you will compile the EWS1 requirements and render the building fire safe (i.e. fall within the definition of A1, A2 or B1) on completion of the remedial works.
- the interim fire safety measures are satisfactory.
- you will not pass on costs or hidden charges to the leaseholder (e.g. via service charges).
- remediation will take place within a reasonable timescale (12 months).
Where remedial costs fall to individual leaseholders/flat owners
For remortgage and purchase, if the building owner’s solicitors confirm in writing, we’ll consider applications where the owner has paid for and planned/started remedial works. We’ll decline any applications if remedial works have not yet been paid for or planned/started.
For further advances, we’ll consider applications if the funds are being raised to carry out the required remedial works. We'll require further information from the building owner to make an assessment, including:
- the compiled EWS1 requirements rendering the building fire safe (i.e. fall within the definition of A1, A2 or B1) on completion of the remedial works.
- confirmation the interim fire safety measures are satisfactory.
- a summary of the remedial works required and when the works will take place.
- costs the leaseholder/flat owner is liable for and when the required funds are due to be paid to the freeholder.
The Building Regulations 2018 banned the use of flammable materials on new high-rise homes. Any buildings started after 21 February 2019 should not contain flammable material.
We require an EWS1 form (PDF, 200KB - opens in a new window) for any New Build designed/constructed under the old regulations. This is regardless of storey height. For example, where there are concerns around wall systems and attachments.
We won’t require an EWS1 form for New Builds that have been/are being constructed in compliance with The Building Regulations 2018. Unless upon inspection, the valuer has concerns regarding other elements of fire safety.
We'll speak to the Developer/Sales Agent. If the valuer can’t confirm that the latest Building Regulations apply, we'll decline the mortgage valuation report. This is pending confirmation from the Building Owner/Developer/Conveyancer whether it’s compliant with The Building Regulations 2018.

# Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMO)


## In this section we cover:

- Definition
- Valuation
- Criteria
- Mandatory HMO licensing
Information:
The status of a property as an HMO will be determined by the valuer

### Definition

We consider the following types of property as a HMO
- A property occupied by five or more people
- A property with five to seven lettable rooms in an area commensurate with multi letting
Properties subject to selective licence are only classified as a HMO where at least one of the above conditions are met.
A property occupied by 4 people or fewer, even if licensed and sharing the characteristics of a HMO, is not eligible for HMO lending. The rental assessment will be based on a single family figure and a non HMO product should be selected.

### Valuation

- All HMO applications, must have a valid EPC with a rating of 'E' or better. We don't accept exemptions for HMOs.
- All HMO applications, including Further Advances, we'll require a Specialist Security valuation, which is payable by the client. See our valuation page for fees.
- For Further Advance and Remortgage applications, before carrying out a valuation, we'll require a copy of the HMO licence. This needs to be attached to the case where the case Requirement has been generated. If this isn’t received within 15 working days, we'll cancel the application .
- You'll need to update us with details of a selective licence. You can do this by emailing us with 'selective license HMO' as the subject.

### Criteria

- Minimum property value is £100,000
- Maximum 75% LTV (See our table for maximum loan amount per property )
- 175% Interest Cover Ratio (ICR) applies to all HMO applications, regardless of tax status.
- For remortgage applications, or borrowers considered a portfolio landlord, there is no need to validate Buy to Let or HMO experience
- For purchase applications where the applicant is not a portfolio landlord, we may need to validate BTL/HMO experience. We define acceptable experiences as:
- 2 years’ ownership and letting experience of a BTL property, or,
- 1 year’s ownership and letting experience of an HMO property.
- We won't accept Let to Buy applications
- For valuation purposes, we'll assess rental cover on a multi-tenanted basis
- All let properties will be subject to an:
- Assured Shorthold Tenancy agreement
- Short Assured Tenancy agreement
- Private Residential Tenancy Agreement in Scotland (there is no maximum tenancy)
- Occupation Contract in Wales (must be a minimum of 6 months, maximum of 36 months).
- Single and multiple tenancy agreements accepted
- A property must have no more than four habitable storeys and no more than one kitchen
- Properties consisting of more than one self-contained unit under a single title are not acceptable
- The property must offer a communal living room. We can consider a large open plan kitchen/living room if it is big enough to meet reasonable occupant needs as a communal room.
- 2 years’ ownership and letting experience of a BTL property, or,
- 1 year’s ownership and letting experience of an HMO property.
- Assured Shorthold Tenancy agreement
- Short Assured Tenancy agreement
- Private Residential Tenancy Agreement in Scotland (there is no maximum tenancy)
- Occupation Contract in Wales (must be a minimum of 6 months, maximum of 36 months).
Please see our general criteria for full details.

### Mandatory HMO licensing

Under the Housing Act 2004 (opens in a new window) , your client must have a licence for all large HMOs in England and Wales. A large HMO is 3 or more storeys and occupied by 5 or more persons forming at least 2 separate households.

#### HMO criteria

We'll lend on properties that need a HMO licence if they meet the following criteria:
- Remortgage and further advance: A relevant current licence must be in place. There may be some cases where proof that a licence has been applied for are acceptable.
- Remortgage converting a residential property to a buy to let: Proof that the relevant licence has been applied for.
- Purchase: Proof that the relevant licence has been applied for.
- All HMO applications must comply with the most current property standards, such as minimum sizes for sleeping rooms. This is the case even where the landlord has a current licence received before the standard changed, as they'll need to meet the standard to renew it.
If a landlord has a licence that is not suitable for their use of the property, we'll decline. We'll require proof that the correct licence has been applied for or obtained.

#### HMO valuations

We'll instruct our valuers to ensure that the property conforms to any prevailing legislation. For example, if any rooms let for sleeping do not meet the current minimum sizes, we'll exclude these from the lettable room count and the Gross Rental Valuation.
See our Valuations page for more details on appeals.

#### Small HMO

Sometimes selective or additional licensing applies to a small HMO (also known as a C4). We don't treat these applications as HMOs unless they meet our definition of HMO above.

#### Article 4 direction

Local authorities use article 4 direction to control the quality of housing in a given area. It limits specific kinds of development, such as converting a property from residential to an HMO.
We'll lend on properties subject to Article 4 direction. We don't treat these applications as HMOs unless they meet our definition of HMO above.
If the property is within an Article 4 direction, we need proof of either:
- Confirmation of Article 4 consent
- Certificate of Lawful Use
We need this before the valuation, and for all application types.

### Valuation policy

Where a physical valuation is required, safety is our number one priority. Valuers will need to carry out a detailed safety assessment with the customer before the valuation is conducted. Where a customer isn’t comfortable letting a valuer into their property we’ll place the application on hold and you’ll need to tell us when they’re ready to proceed.
Valuers may also carry out an ‘external only’ assessment. A safety assessment will still be completed and the valuer will explain the process to the customer. Where more information is needed and photos of the property may help, the valuer will request them from the applicant/vendor. If this is necessary, full support will be provided by telephone/email.
Valuation reports are valid for a period of 3 months. Please be aware that a mortgage offer must be issued prior to the valuation report expiring.
Re-inspection fee is £100. The Mortgage Works reserves the right to conduct an additional inspection of the property. For example, to ensure the completion of a New Build property originally valued off plans.
If you're unsure whether the property would be suitable security for us, you can complete this Pre-valuation enquiry form .
The valuation will be carried out when the relevant fee has been received.
Please refer to our Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMO) page for further guidance.

### Valuation appeals

If you wish to appeal the valuation figure, it’s important that it fits our criteria. We'll need the following information to consider your appeal and will reject appeals which do not provide the following:
- Details of at least two comparable properties. They must be of similar type, style, size and location to the subject property and be sold/rented within the last six months.
- A summary/additional comparables explaining why you're appealing the valuation based on the information and comparable evidence provided.
- For New Build properties, three comparable sales are required, one from the same site, one from a similar local New Build site and a Non New Build property in the local area.
Important information:
- Appeals received with missing information, or which don’t meet the necessary requirements will be rejected.
- Valuations can only be appealed within 10 working days of you or your client being made aware of the valuation outcome.
- We’ll respond to the appeal within 10 working days. The response will be the final outcome and the valuation can’t be appealed again.
It’s important that you review the above criteria first before contacting us. Once you have all the relevant information to hand you can contact broker support who will send you the Valuations Appeal form, which should be submitted to valuation.appeals@nationwide.co.uk .

### Transcribed valuations

We don't accept transcriptions for valuation purposes on Scottish Buy to Let Applications. We'll instruct our own Mortgage Valuation Report on all cases as a valuation fee will be payable by the customer.

### Energy Efficiency Regulations

The Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) provides details on the energy performance of a property and what your client can do to improve it.
When submitting an application make sure you input the correct property address, as we'll verify that it has a valid EPC or exemption on the register.
You can find exemption details at Domestic Private Rented Landlord Guidance (opens in a new window)

#### Properties in England and Wales

Check your client's property has a valid EPC.
- Find an energy certificate (opens in a new window)
Applications at 75% LTV or below
We'll need a valid EPC submitted with all applications, unless there is a valid exemption. The EPC needs to be rated 'E' or higher. This applies to properties where there are existing tenants, as well as properties where a new tenancy is being created. Until we receive this, we can't instruct a valuation or progress the application.
Applications above 75% LTV
The property must have an EPC rated 'C' or above. We'll decline applications on properties which don't meet the criteria, including appeals. You will then need to resubmit an application with an LTV of 75% or below and a new product selected.
Remortgage with capital raising (including Porting)
As part of any remortgage with capital raising application, for example to purchase or refurbish another property, we'll expect your client to carry out the works required to bring the security asset up to a minimum 'E' rating (minimum 'C' rating for applications over 75% LTV).
New Build
You don't need to provide proof of an EPC rating for a New Build application, as it won't be available until after the property is completed.
Further advance
All further advance applications require a valid EPC before submission. The Valuer will be unable to recommend the property as a suitable security without a valid EPC. We'll reconsider the property once you provide a valid EPC.
We'll consider applications where a properties EPC rating is outside of our policy, subject to the following:
- For applications at 75% LTV or below: if the EPC rating is F or G, we'll only accept a further advance where the sole purpose of the additional borrowing is to fund improvements to make the property compliant with EPC minimum standards of E rated or above.
- For applications over 75% LTV: if the EPC rating is D, E, F or G, we'll only accept a Green Further Advance application where the sole purpose is to fund improvements to make the property compliant with our policy of C rated or above.
The valuer will assess the EPC data and detail any works needed to bring the property to the minimum standards above in the valuation report. We'll reflect the costs of any works in the valuation figure.
Green Further Advance applications
We'll place a condition on the mortgage offer confirming your client must undertake the work within 3 months. We can reinspect the property 3 months after completion to:
- ensure your client has carried out the work or
- requested an updated EPC to show they have made the improvements.
If the application is for any other further advance product (as per current retention policy), the application can proceed where the cost of work is no more than:
- £2,500 (for properties with a current value of up to £100,000)
- £5,000 (for properties with a current value over £100,000)
A full retention will be applicable if the cost of the work exceeds the values above. We'll calculate the maximum loan and LTV on the purchase price or the figure before the work whichever is lower.
For portfolio applications the valuation policy detailed here will only apply to the property on the new application. We won't assess EPC ratings on other properties held with other lenders.
Post completion lending criteria
Landlords must comply with the new regulations for post completion contract variations. This includes transfer of equity, conversions or term amendments.

#### Properties in Scotland

This includes purchase, remortgage, further advance and porting applications.
Check your client's property has a valid EPC
- 
We'll continue to lend on all properties with an EPC rating of F or G. However, the Valuer will assess the EPC data and detail any works needed to bring the property to a minimum E rating in the valuation report.
We'll reflect the costs of any work in the valuation figure, and place a condition on the mortgage offer confirming the work that your client must undertake within 3 months. Unless your client sends us proof of a valid exemption or an updated EPC prior to completion.
To ensure you have carried out the work, we can reinspect the property 3 months after completion.
As per current retention policy, the application can proceed where the cost of work is no more than:
- £2,500 (for properties with a current value of up to £100,000)
- £5,000 (for properties with a current value over £100,000)
A full retention will be applicable if the cost of the work exceeds the values above.
We calculate the maximum loan and LTV on the purchase price or the figure before the work, whichever is lower.

### Other information

- The valuer will be instructed by The Mortgage Works to determine the suitability of the security.
- In the case of BTL applications, we will apply the lower of passing rent or estimated rental value as given by the valuer.
- For all standard BTL applications, the estimated rental value will be based on the market rent for single family occupancy. (See Houses in Multiple Occupation for cases submitted as an HMO).
- If the valuation has been carried out and the property has been found to be of unsuitable security or the application does not proceed, the valuation fee will not be refunded.

### Using the system

How to amend your submitted application
After a full application has been submitted, it’s not possible to make amendments to the case via TMW Online. Once the case has been assigned an Application ID and you wish to make a material change, please email tmw.applications@themortgageworks.co.uk to request any changes.
How to change a product
If the full application hasn’t been fully submitted, it’s possible to resubmit the DIP and select an alternative product.
If the application has been submitted, please contact the updates team by emailing tmw.applications@themortgageworks.co.uk .
For like for like port applications, you may be asked to select a new product if the requested total loan amount is higher than the existing loan amount entered. You'll need to revisit the loan requirements.
How to print case documentation
For a submitted mortgage application:
- Search for the case you require from the TMW Online home page and click 'Open case' which will open the case tracking screen.
- All documentation generated for the case will be available on the case tracking screen.
Click on the relevant document to open and print.
For mortgage applications that have not yet been submitted, you can access documentation via the Documents link on the DIP and full mortgage application screens.
Our Contact us page has all the information you need if you have a pre or post application query.
Reserving a product
To reserve a product, you will need to complete and submit the full mortgage application paying any applicable fees for the product selected.
How can I access my colleague’s case?
You'll be unable to access the case online, however you can obtain further updates on the case by contacting the updates team on 0345 605 40 40 , then press option 2.
Non Standard Tenancy Agreement
The standard form of letting agreement we accept is an Assured Shorthold Tenancy, or either a Short Assured Tenancy, Occupation Contract in Wales or a Private Residential Tenancy in Scotland. Where this isn’t used, we’ll consider this a non standard tenancy.
We accept the following tenant types on a non standard tenancy basis:
- Corporate Tenancy – A company is the tenant for the purposes of housing one of its employees and associated family. The tenant company must employ a minimum of 1,000 people and we won’t consider any sub-letting arrangements.
- Local Authority/Housing Association Tenancy
- A private tenant where the rent is greater than £100,000 and therefore falls outside the limits of an Assured Shorthold Tenancy.
In line with standard tenancy agreements, the solicitor is responsible for checking the terms of the tenancy are acceptable to us, based on our lender information displayed in the UK Finance Handbook. The maximum term of 36 months also applies (except in the case of a Private Residential Tenancy which does not have a fixed term).
My client has lived at multiple addresses in the last 3 years. Can I submit their case online?
You can provide up to 9 previous addresses for your client, although additional information may be required in some cases.
If you get an error message
If you get an error message when keying a Let to Buy application this is most likely caused by trying to submit Let to Buy applications as a purchase.
Please check the application has been submitted as a remortgage. If you’re still receiving an error message, please contact us using .

### Packaging support case requirements

You need to submit your client's case requirements after you've received our confirmation email at the Full Mortgage Application (FMA) stage. You can upload these to TMW Online using our scan and attach facility - you don't need to email or post supporting documents.
Once the full mortgage application has been submitted, you can find a list of case requirements on the 'valuation and assessment' section within the case tracking screen.
The case requirements will be confirmed to you within your DIP response and also when you submit the full mortgage application.
We’ll only ask for additional information for complex cases where it’s necessary for us to make a decision.
If your client needs to provide case requirements you've already submitted, you can tell us the FMA reference number for the case requirements you’ve already sent and we’ll match them up. Alternatively you can resend these quoting the new Full Mortgage Application (FMA) reference number.
Back to top

### Producing a Mortgage Illustration

You must have created a case before producing a Mortgage Illustration.
You'll be given the option of creating a Mortgage Illustration once a case has been created, and again as part of the product section of the full mortgage application. Once generated, Mortgage Illustrations are saved to the case which can be accessed via the Documents link throughout DIP and full mortgage application.
When the full mortgage application has been submitted, you'll also be able to view the Mortgage Illustration via case tracking.
Back to top

### 

For a TMW online case, you'll be able to retrieve your DIP certificate directly from the DIP response screen. If you wish to access the DIP certificate after this point, it'll be available via the Documents link throughout the full mortgage application. When the full mortgage application has been submitted, you'll also be able to view the certificate via case tracking.
Amending a DIP
You can amend details on the DIP (excluding applicant personal details), at any time prior to submission of the full application. This can be done by clicking 'Amend DIP' from the DIP response screen or 'Back to DIP' at any point during the full mortgage application. Rather than submitting another DIP, you can amend the existing DIP by following the steps in the 'how can I amend a DIP' question.
If you amend details on the DIP, you will lose your current DIP decision status and will need to re-run through the DIP pages, amend and resubmit.
Once you've done this and received an 'accept', the new DIP certificate can be viewed within the Documents link throughout the full mortgage application. When the full mortgage application has been submitted, you'll also be able to view the certificate via case tracking.
Another footprint won't be left with the Credit Reference Agency / Bureau if it's within 60 days of the original DIP.
If you need to speak to us, you either call our Mortgage New Business Team on 0345 605 40 40 then press option 2 or 3 or email dip@themortgageworks.co.uk .

### Credit Reference Agencies/Bureaus

For the assessment of lending risk, we use the three major UK credit reference agencies and bureaus:
- Equifax
- TransUnion
- Experian
We’ll search at least one agency for an application. If we require additional information or don’t get an exact match we’ll search the other agencies.
All lenders are required to leave a footprint highlighting when they've performed a search connected with mortgage lending. If we have to use more than one Credit Reference Agency or Bureau, we're required to leave a footprint at each agency used.
Please note: The Mortgage Works will only carry out searches which leave a hard footprint .

If you're having any issues logging in, please check with your clients to make sure that you’ve got the correct details. If you’re still receiving an error message, please contact us on .

## What happens once I've logged in?

Follow the steps below to find out how to switch your client’s mortgage using our OMS service.
Before beginning the application, make sure your client has read the ' Things you need to consider before switching ' statement.
Then check if your client meets the following eligibility:
- Their mortgage switch deal with us is either:
- ending in the next 13 weeks
- on one of our revert rates
- or is a tracker product with a switch to fix option .
- Their current mortgage balance isn’t less than £1,000.
- They have more than two years remaining on their mortgage term.
- Their mortgage is clear of arrears.
- Their mortgage (when taken out) wasn't regulated by the Consumer Credit Act.
- They’re not subject to a Bankruptcy Order or Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA).
- There must be no restrictions preventing a product switch
- They don't live in the European Economic Area (EEA) or the European Union (EU) - they must be living in the UK or a non EEA/EU country.
- ending in the next 13 weeks
- on one of our revert rates
- or is a tracker product with a switch to fix option .
There's no need for us to complete a new credit search as part of the switcher process.
Please submit a paper based application if your client’s property is either a portfolio account or valued at £1 million or over. You can return this without client signatures by email to TMWDirect@themortgageworks.co.uk .
Switcher product options will reflect the lending type on the initial application. If circumstances have changed for your client and this effects their product eligibility (e.g. Portfolio reduced to less than 10 properties), please contact TMWDirect@themortgageworks.co.uk . You'll need to quote their mortgage account number and the reason for your email.
If your client does not meet the criteria, they may still be able to switch (for example being in arrears). To do this they'll need to contact us directly.
After logging in to the OMS following the steps above, your client should confirm whether they want to add the product fee (if applicable) to their loan, or pay it upfront. The OMS will then show all the mortgage deals they are eligible for. Up to four mortgage products can be compared against:
- Rates
- Monthly mortgage payments
- Mortgage features
- Fees (if a fee is applicable, your client can pay this up front or add it to their loan).
Your client won’t be credit scored as part of their application.
We’ll automatically estimate your client’s property value to establish their latest loan to value. If you or your client believe the valuation is incorrect, you can email TMWDirect@themortgageworks.co.uk to appeal the valuation.
You’ll need to tell us:
- The Mortgage Works account number
- Customer name
- Security address
- Property value
- I (Broker Number/FCA Number) can confirm that I have been instructed to act in relation to the product switch for the above customer and would like to request a valuation appeal.
After that, we’ll contact you for more details. This may include information about structural or cosmetic work on the property. We may ask for evidence, such as photos, planning permission and completion certificates.
If you’re unhappy with the valuation after appeal, your client can pay for a valuer to visit the property for a physical inspection.
Your client can select the mortgage they want and decide whether to add the product fee (if applicable) to their loan or pay it upfront. This will create an offer which summarises all the important features of the mortgage. This includes any fees and charges you have to pay online. As the entire process needs to be completed online and therefore they can’t pay by cheque. If they’ve received a paper offer through our paper application process, they'll need to check the information contained in the offer pack.
The offer is valid for 21 days. And it won’t be binding until your client has accepted the offer and paid the product fee (if applicable). You'll only reserve the product once the application has been submitted in full.
You'll need to select a new product if:
- Your product changes before your application has been submitted in full. OR
- The offer expires
If your client isn’t happy with the mortgage offer, they can select another deal by choosing ' Select New Product' . This will replace any previous offer.
If your client needs to think about the offer, they can choose to Save the offer. This will allow your client to consider their options before committing to the new deal. When you log back into the OMS, you’ll have to log in using your client’s details. Once you've done this the switch information will appear in your recent cases.
If your client is ready to proceed, you should print or save the mortgage offer before accepting it. If you don't you won't be able access it after accepting. Switch them to the new deal by selecting Continue to Next Step (read step 4 for more information on what happens next).
If the OMS isn’t able to generate an instant offer, we'll need to create it manually. Once you’ve submitted the switch, you’ll get a message advising that we’ll be in touch within 3-5 working days. Once the manual offer has been produced, we’ll make contact to advise you the offer is available. You can then log back into the OMS to accept the offer and continue. You’ll have to log in using your client’s details, as the switch information won’t appear in your recent cases.
Where an instant offer isn't available and you have to follow this process, we’ll honour the rate requested. This includes withdrawn products.
If your client is happy with the product and fee payment option (if applicable) chosen, you should print or save the mortgage offer.
If you pay the product fee by credit card, you may have to pay an additional fee from your credit card provider. You can contact them for more details.
Select Accept and the OMS will tell you when their new product begins. Once your client has accepted the offer, they’ll need to pay any product fee applicable (unless they have chosen to add it to the loan).
You’ll then see confirmation that the OMS application process has been completed successfully.
If your client is looking to complete a rate switch and a further advance, these are two separate applications and you 'll need to decide which to do first.
If you complete a rate switch application first, we're unable to guarantee that a further advance application will be accepted subsequently.
Completing a further advance first may mean that any subsequent rate switch could be charged at a higher rate due to the increased LTV.  The further advance will need to have completed prior to a rate switch application.
If your clients have started a further advance application but don’t want to continue with this as they would rather proceed with a Rate Switch, we’ll require instructions from your clients to cancel the application. This can be included with the paper application form for the product switch.

### Switching Multiple Sub Loans

If your client has multiple sub loans due for renewal within the same window you can switch using the online portal. However, if the current product expiry dates differ, the new rates will align using the latest end date. This may mean for a short time a Standard Variable Rate will apply on part(s) of the account.
Alternatively, you can switch one of the loans using the online portal and the remaining using the product switch application form. This will prevent the Standard Variable Rate from being applied on part(s) of the account.
By obtaining a separate offer, the same product and terms may not be available and additional fees may apply.
If you wish to continue with switching your clients’ sub loan outside of the online portal, you can email tmwdirect@themortgageworks.co.uk a paper application form mentioning the loan you are looking to switch. After that, we may contact you for more details.

#### Manual application for multi switch accounts

If you have already submitted  a product switch for an account we are unable to progress a further request on our Online Mortgage Switcher. In order to submit your loan Mortgage Illustration request please email tmwdirect@themortgageworks.co.uk with the following information.
You’ll need to tell us:
- The Mortgage Works account number
- Sub Loan being switched
- Customer name
- Security address
- Rate Switch Product Code
- Fee paid upfront or add to loan
- Network/Club
- Your (Broker) Name
- I (Broker Number/FCA Number) confirm and declare that I have been instructed by the applicant(s) named above to switch to another The Mortgage Works mortgage product (‘product switch’) and to complete this request for and on behalf of them.
- I have outlined the nature of the mortgage and the product to the applicant(s) and explained the nature and amount of the fees payable by the applicant(s). And I have confirmed with the applicant(s) which fees are not refundable even if you don't offer them a mortgage or the mortgage product switch does not proceed for any other reason.
We’ll contact you once the Mortgage Illustration has been produced. This can take up to 5 working days. If your client is happy to proceed, you'll need to contact us on 0345 606 40 60 in order to provide verbal acceptance.

#### Can I switch an additional account where I have already applied for a rate Switch?

Where you already have an application in progress for one account, and you are looking to switch an additional sub account you will need to wait until the existing application completes, or you can apply by email as above.
By cancelling the existing application, it could result in an account reverting to the standard variable rate.  If you obtain a separate offer, the same product and terms may not be available and product fees will be payable on each account, if applicable.
If the product fee is paid when the offer is accepted and your clients change their mind prior to completion, we’ll return the product fee. If you choose multiple products there may be additional fees.
If they choose to add the product fee to the loan when the offer is accepted, then no money will have been taken and therefore no money will be returned.
Once the switch completes, your clients can’t cancel and therefore the product fee is non-refundable.
You or your clients can cancel the switch 5 days prior to completion using the Online Mortgage Switcher. If it’s less than 5 days to completion, they can cancel the switch by calling us on 0345 606 40 60 .

#### Your payment date is within the first 7 working days of the month

We’ll do our best to bring you onto your new rate in time for your first payment, though that might not be possible if its due within the first 7 working days of the month. In this case, we’ll simply collect your first payment at the Managed Rate. Then the following month, we’ll change your payment to your newly switched rate, adjusting it to make up for any overpayment made in the first month.
If you want to avoid this, you can push back your regular direct debit payment date to later in the month. This gives us enough time to move you onto your new rate.
Please let us know by the 10th of the month by calling 0345 605 40 60 .

#### Having trouble with payments

Please check that you have entered the details correctly. If the card details are correct: you’ll need to contact your card supplier in the unlikely event that there’s a technical problem. Or you can try again later. The application will be saved for you or your clients to access at a later time.
For applications where an ERC is payable, you'll need to complete a paper based application form .  These can be submitted to TMWDirect@themortgageworks.co.uk .  An offer will be produced which includes any ERC payable. To proceed, we’ll require payment of the ERC up front before we issue an offer. These requests may take a little longer to process.

#### Switch to Fix

If the current product has the 'switch-to-fix' feature, your clients can apply to switch to a fixed rate during the ERC period. The start date for product switches are always the 1st of the month and the date the switch occurs depends on the date they accept the product switch offer. The date will be confirmed when they accept the offer.
To apply, your client will need to contact us directly to apply. They won't be able to apply to extend their term on regulated cases. We do accept non-regulated cases.
Your clients can't apply to extend their term as part of a product switch.
They'll need to contact Account Servicing on 0345 606 40 60 to arrange for a change to their repayment method.
Your clients can repay their mortgage at any time. This depends on the product chosen at product switch as an early repayment charge may apply. Please refer to your client's offer.
If your client has started a product switch already and wants to change repayment method, they don’t need to wait for it to complete. The quote that’s provided for the change of repayment method doesn’t include any new products which are due to start in the next 3 months. The amount quoted is an estimated figure and is subject to change once the new product has started.
Depending on the product chosen, your client may be able to make extra payments on their new product. Please see your client's offer
To discuss varying their terms, please obtain their authority or ask them to speak to us. Your client can book an appointment or give us a call (opens in a new window) .
We’ll use your client's existing direct debit details to make changes to the payment. If they don’t want us to use the existing direct debit details, they must instruct us of the new details by calling 0345 606 40 60 .
If your client isn’t happy with the mortgage switch, and they haven’t accepted it, they can choose another deal by choosing Select New Product . This will replace any previous offer. No fees are chargeable for this.
You or your client can use our Online Mortgage Switcher (OMS) (opens in a new window) to cancel up to 5 days before the product switch completion date.
Or email us on tmwdirect@themortgageworks.co.uk if it's less than 5 days to completion.
If the mortgage switch has completed
Your client will need to pay the applicable Early Repayment Charge to switch to another product. This is unless they have a Switch-to-Fix incentive on the new product.
If you or your client have accepted the mortgage switch and it hasn't completed
Firstly you will need to cancel the mortgage switch. You can do this either through OMS or telephone.
You'll receive a refund within 10 working days for any fees paid up front.
Once the mortgage switch has completed (on the 1st of the month shown as part of the acceptance of the offer), your client will receive a confirmation letter detailing their new mortgage product and monthly repayments.
Your client should receive this letter within the first 5 working days of the month after the switch has completed.
Important information for payment dates that fall within the first seven working days of the month
To comply with regulations, we must provide your client with notice of their new payment before we collect it from their bank or building society. This means if your client's monthly payment is due within the first seven working days of the month, we won’t be able to tell your client their revised monthly payment before their first payment is collected after the mortgage switch.
Therefore, the first payment due following their product switch will be at the standard variable rate detailed in the terms of their existing mortgage. We’ll then adjust the following months payment to reflect any under or overpayment paid in the first month.
To avoid this, your client can change their monthly payment date to later in the month by calling us on 0345 606 40 60 .

#### Monthly rest accounts

All of our product switch options are ‘monthly rest’ accounts. This is where the account balance at the date of offer is used to calculate the monthly payments. You may find that the monthly payment displayed on the ‘view products’ page varies to the amount displayed on the personalised offer. This will happen where your client has an ‘annual rest’ interest only account and the account balance at 31 March is used to calculate the monthly payments. The figure displayed on the offer document is the figure agreed upon confirmation of the switch.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# How to submit a case

Note:
Intermediaries can only submit their own mortgage application directly as a customer. Alternatively, your application can be submitted through TMW Online (opens in a new window) by another intermediary.

## Limited Company, porting and further advance applications

Most applications can be submitted via TMW Online (opens in a new window).
Limited Company, porting and further advance applications submitted via TMW Online go straight to full mortgage application (FMA).
There is no decision in principle (DIP) produced before FMA, as the application is assessed when the FMA is received. To get a Mortgage Illustration for porting and further advances, a request must be made using the Manual Mortgage Illustration Request Form
For Limited Company cases, you can get these from your sourcing system.

## Product switch applications

Product switch applications for properties valued under £1 million can be completed via the Online Mortgage Switcher (OMS). You can also find out more around eligibility and support when switching.

## Paper exceptions

The following application types need to be submitted as paper applications:
- Product switch applications for properties valued at £1 million or over - you'll need to complete one of our product switch application forms
- Transfer of Equity - you'll need to complete one of our Transfer of equity application forms
- Limited Company Buy to Let applications submitted before 2018 (this applies for existing borrowers and not for new borrowing. However, like for like porting applications can be considered).
Postal Paper applications and supporting information should be sent to:
Northampton Administration Centre Kings Park Road Moulton Park Northampton, NN3 6NW

# Payments


## This page includes:

- How we'll calculate interest on your clients first payment
- Early Repayment Charges (ERCs)
- Overpayments
- Making a one-off overpayment
- Repaying part or all of the mortgage early
- Capital repayment allowance

### How we'll calculate interest on your clients first payment

The first payment will total more than the regular monthly payments. This is because the first payment covers previous interest from the date the account goes live to the date of the first regular payment being due.
For example, if your client completes on 18 April their first payment will include interest charged from the day funds are released to the end of that month, plus interest for the following month. They'll need to consider this when setting a completion date.
Tip:
Assets held by the customer for repayment of the mortgage are not acceptable where it's denominated in a currency other than pounds sterling (GBP).

### Early Repayment Charges (ERCs)

If your client’s mortgage is with The Mortgage Works, Derbyshire Home Loans or E-Mex Home Funding and is on a Managed Rate or Variable Rate, they can overpay as much as they like, there’s no ERCs.
There are other mortgage products that are on fixed or Lifetime Variable rates, which will usually have an overpayment allowance of 10% a year. Some of our products do have a different allowance. To find out how much they can overpay as a regular or lump sum payment (without an ERC charge), your clients can contact us on 0345 606 40 60 .
We won't charge your ERCs, if your clients choose to make an overpayment within the last month of their product term.

### Overpayments

Unless you let us know, we’ll apply your client’s overpayment to their mortgage using the following principles in this order; providing they're within their overpayment allowance(s):
1. Interest only mortgages.
2. Highest interest rate (where there is more than one account on the mortgage).
3. Highest balance (where there is more than one account on the mortgage).
We can only accept payments from bank accounts that match the name(s) on the mortgage. We'll return any payments made that don’t match the name(s) on the mortgage.
Your client can make lump sum or regular overpayments of up to 10% of the initial mortgage balance in each 12-month period from the anniversary of completion, or the anniversary of the most recent product switch date, without having to pay any ERCs. This isn't available if the whole loan is being repaid or security released.
Should your client wish to overpay more than 10% and not be subject to ERCs, they'll need to be on the standard variable rate or within the last month of their product term.

### Making a one-off overpayment

Tip:
With a one-off overpayment:
- If they make an overpayment of £5,000 on 19 June, the overpayment is credited to the account
- From 20 June, we'll reduce the mortgage balance, and reduce the interest due at the end of the month
- On 1 July, we'll calculate the interest due for the month of July, based on the reduced mortgage balance
- Their monthly payments due are usually re-calculated.

### Online

Your clients can use our bank details to transfer money online. Please ensure you input the correct details.
Your clients will need to use their mortgage account number as the reference.

Account type: Business

### Repaying part or all of the mortgage early

If your client decides to repay all or part of their mortgage early, an ERC may apply. We'll base the ERC on the type of interest rate your client has, the amount they're repaying and the date they took out their mortgage.

### Capital repayment allowance

Your client can make lump sum or regular overpayments of up to 10% of the initial mortgage balance in each 12-month period from the anniversary of completion, without having to pay any ERCs. This isn't available if the whole loan is being repaid or security released.
Assets held by the customer for repayment of the mortgage are not acceptable where it's denominated in a currency other than pounds sterling (GBP).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 

Alongside building lasting relationships with you, our intermediaries, we constantly seek to improve experiences for landlords. Two recent developments allow your clients greater access to their mortgage information, which you can use to support them.

## Before, during and following mortgage maturity

It’s important that landlords are in an informed position about their mortgage, especially when their current mortgage is coming to an end.
To ensure they’re informed, we provide digital access to key information they’ll need when making decisions about what to do next.

### How do landlords access this?

We start communicating with landlords 6 months prior to their mortgage maturity. During this time landlords can log in online and see:
- their current rate and monthly payment alongside their revert rate
- an illustration of what their payment could be if they take no action.
However, they're unable to take any action to change their mortgage deal until the 13 week switch window opens.
All communications reference a broker relationship. And at any point landlords can opt out of communications and advise (through the tool) that they’re working with you.

### When does this happen? Mortgage maturity – a countdown:

6 - 4 months prior to maturity: Online access becomes available. Landlords can see their current rate and monthly payment. They can see what their rate and monthly payment would be if they revert to the managed rate. If landlords are working with you, they can inform us through a simple click selection, and we’ll stop contacting them.
3 – 0 months prior to maturity: We continue offering landlords the opportunity to tell us they are working with you and to stop us contacting them. But we offer them the option to:
- to find a broker to support them with their maturity, or
- manage their product switch directly online.
After maturity: If we can see that a landlord remains on the managed rate we'll contact them for 2 further months following maturity. This is so we can understand if they need help.

## Managing mortgages digitally

Landlords can explore their mortgage information and make administration changes quickly online. They will be able to see information like their mortgage balance, direct debits, statements, next payment date and the amount.
The information landlords can access could be helpful supporting your conversations when they are reviewing their portfolio and future opportunities.
To access their mortgage information, your clients will need to register. They can do so in four easy steps, but they will need to have their telephone number registered as part of their mortgage account.
To register we'll ask them to:
- confirm and verify their email address
- complete some details including name and account number
- confirm their telephone number
- create a password
Once they are registered they can log in any time. We'll ask them to authenticate with their telephone number each time they log in, just to keep their account safe.
You can share this link (opens in a new window) with your landlord clients and it will give them all of the information they need.

#### Vulnerability support

We want to ensure that your clients who could be vulnerable get the support they need to access our products and services.

#### Switch your clients' mortgage

When your clients' mortgage deal is coming to an end, they'll be eligible to switch using our Online Mortgage Switcher (OMS) service

# Going green

We could all do more to help the planet, and our properties have a huge impact on climate change. According to the government's latest greenhouse emissions study (opens in a new window) , 15% of carbon emissions comes from homes. The right improvements can make a big difference, and you or your tenant could save money on energy bills.

## Green Further Advances

If your client already has a buy to let mortgage with The Mortgage Works and wants to make energy efficient home improvements, they could borrow up to 75% of the value of their property (including their current mortgage).
Green Further Advance mortgages

## What we are doing to go greener

As the buy to let lender of Nationwide, we’ve collectively taken steps to ensure we’re going greener.
- We use 100% renewable electricity and don’t send any waste to landfill
- We are carbon neutral. This includes all energy use and emissions for our internal operations and fleet vehicles
- Nationwide is a member of the Green Finance Institute's Coalition for the Energy Efficiency of Buildings (opens in a new window). Working to promote the benefits of energy efficient buildings.

# Client support needs

Looking after our customers is important to us. We want to ensure it's easy for your clients to get the support they need to access our products and services. Sharing your clients' support needs will not affect our decision to lend.

## How you can help your clients' with their support needs

A support need is anything that will help your client get the most out of their interactions with us. We want your clients to be able to access our products and services without barriers. So, where possible, we will adjust certain processes or how we communicate with them.
For example, it may be helpful for your client to get letters with larger print. Or they need people to speak slowly and clearly, so they are better able to understand information.
Tell us about your clients' support needs by completing and emailing the following form to vulnerable.customers@nationwide.co.uk . You can do this at any point after submitting an application.
Share your clients' support needs
Before you share your clients' support needs with us, please ensure you have asked your client for permission and have their consent to record their support needs with us. You also need to ensure they understand how we will use their information .
Information:

## How clients' can tell us about their support needs

The benefits of this are:
- They won't have to repeat themselves to other organisations
- They control which organisations know about their support needs
- They will automatically receive the support they need
- Their personal data is safe and secure

## What is vulnerability?

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) defines a vulnerable customer as someone who "due to their personal circumstances, is especially susceptible to harm, particularly when a firm is not acting with appropriate levels of care."
This means a client could be vulnerable if they are in a situation that is making it difficult for them to manage their finances. Examples could include a life event such as bereavement or job loss. Or a mental or physical illness such as anxiety or cancer. Vulnerability can take many forms and below are further examples.
- Physical disability
- Severe or long term illness
- Hearing or visual impairment
- Mental health condition or disability
- Addiction
- Low mental capacity or cognitive disability
- Retirement
- Bereavement
- Job loss
- Relationship breakdown
- Domestic abuse
- Caring responsibilities
- Inadequate or erratic income
- Over indebtedness
- Low savings
- Low emotional resilience
- Lack of support or structure
- Low knowledge or confidence in managing finances
- Poor literacy or numeracy skills
- Poor English language skills
- Poor or non existent digital skills
- Learning impairments
- No or low access to help or support

## What is a support need?

A support need is something a client has asked us to do to make sure they can access our products and services without barriers. For example, it may be helpful for them to get letters with larger print. Or perhaps they just need people to speak slowly and clearly, so they are better able to understand information.

## Vulnerability toolkit

Here are some tools to help identify if your client has support needs. And how to talk to your clients about them.
I – Impact What happens? What is the problem?
D – Duration How long has it been going on for?
E – Experience Has it happened before? Could it happen again?
A – Assistance Does the client have any help or need any help?
Think of this as part of your solution. It's your IDEA for how to give the client assistance.
B - Behaviour and talk Look out for or monitor a clients’ behaviour for signs that they are experiencing difficulties with understanding and decision making
R – Remembering Is the client experiencing any problems with their memory or recall? For example, are they asking you to repeat what you are saying
U – Understanding Does the client grasp or understand the information given to them? For example, are they looking confused?
C – Communicating Can the client share and communicate their thoughts, questions and decisions about what they want to do?
E - Evaluating Can the client weigh up the different options open to them?
The TEXAS protocol below, should be used to ensure the client is aware what information we are gathering and how we use it.
T – Thank the client for giving you the information e.g. “Thank you for telling me about your situation, it will help us to help you”
E – Explain how the information will be used. The Mortgage Works will use this information to personalise the service offered to clients where possible
X – Explicit consent should be obtained from the client to use information in this way
A – Ask questions to establish key information, this will help you understand the situation better. For example: “How does your situation affect your ability to communicate with us?”
S – Signpost them to the most appropriate internal/external help resources e.g. a free debt-advice agency or the NHS111 line for health problems.

### How do I identify if recording support needs will help in the future?

Here are some things to consider when assessing whether or not recording your client’s support needs will be the best outcome for them:
- How do the client’s circumstances affect their ability to manage their money?
- Do you think the type of help and support they need is a one off request / short term or is it likely to last longer?
- Are there any barriers that we could remove to make it easier for the client now?
- Will a support needs alert ensure a better or more consistent experience for the client?

# Working together to prevent mortgage fraud


## Spotting potential mortgage fraud


### Who to keep an eye out for

People don't always choose to commit fraud. Mortgage fraud can be committed by genuine but desperate people who don't realise they are committing fraud, or the implications of what they are doing.
They are often driven to secure a mortgage on a property after facing pressure from their family and they may do this by exaggerating their income. As many as 1 in 6 adults will exaggerate their income to secure a mortgage.**
There are professionals who commit mortgage fraud for the sole purpose of financial gain. They are experienced and often linked to organised criminal groups. They will have a deep understanding of the industry and how to avoid controls.

### What to look out for when reviewing documents and information

Payslips - when you are collecting your clients' payslips, keep an eye out for:
- Tax - correct tax code, regular payment of tax and correct tax calculations.
- Rounding - rounded numbers are extremely rare on genuine payslips.
- Benefits - check that additional benefits match the wage and job status.
- Format - check the format matches the type or size of the employer.
Staged income - when you are checking your clients' income look out for staged income. Staged income is where applicants create fake income streams and regular payments throughout the application process, which end after completion. Be aware of:
- Applicants who are only employed for a short time before the mortgage application.
- Salary credits paid by 'Faster Payment' instead of BACS.
- Changes in job types that appear out of line with previous roles.
- A recent second job where income is needed to support the application.
- Employers who are small or difficult to trace, or are a family member.
Important:

## Protecting against mortgage fraud

There are also steps you can take to help us protect against mortgage fraud:
- Please report any suspicions as soon as possible. Please email tellsid@nationwide.co.uk or get in touch with your Business Development Manager, and we'll do everything we can to investigate.
- Ensure the clients details you are entering into our systems are accurate (mobile, email and address) and do not enter your own details.
- If you are working with a new client, check they are who they say they are. Use Companies House, LinkedIn or other social media channels.
* Fraud costs the UK economy £193 billion a year, equating to more than £6,000 lost per second every day - Experian UK (opens in a new window) .
** Cifas research reveals 1 in 6 UK adults have exaggerated earnings to secure a mortgage.

# Bank of England base rate changes


## What has changed

On Thursday 8 May 2025, the Bank of England announced a decrease in its base rate from 4.50% to 4.25% .

## Tracker mortgages

We’ll be decreasing tracker rate mortgages indexed to the base rate by 0.25% from 1 June 2025 , in line with existing terms and conditions.

## Managed rates

We’re working through what this means for managed rates and other variable rates and we’ll update our website in due course.
The Mortgage Works managed rate is a variable rate with no upper limit or cap. It's not tied to the Bank of England base rate. It will change to reflect changes in general interest rates, the law, regulation and changes in our costs. You can see the managed rate on the product selection screen and in your client's offer.

## Fixed rate mortgages

If your client is on a fixed rate mortgage, nothing will change.
The interest rate and monthly payments stay the same until the end of the fixed deal.

- Sort code - 20-12-04
- Account number – 00117935

Read our top tips for registering a Limited Company Mortgage Deed with Companies House
Porting is where a customer is moving an existing The Mortgage Works mortgage from one property to another.
How we process porting applications
We can consider porting applications for both regulated and non-regulated mortgages. You can arrange for a Non-regulated porting application through an intermediary. We process these in the same way as any other new application. For porting applications, please call us on 0345 606 40 60 for a porting pack.
When you are ready to complete
Once the new application has been offered and you and the customer are ready to complete, you'll need to request a redemption statement. You can do this by emailing SL.redemptions@nationwide.co.uk .
If the customer has an active product on the existing mortgage, early repayment charges (ERCs) may apply. You can find these detailed on your redemption statement.
The ERC isn't payable on the redemption of the account provided you meet the following criteria:
- The existing fixed rate/redemption clauses are transferred to the new loan.
- The new capital balance is equal to or greater than the current capital balance. If the balance on the new mortgage is less, we will calculate an ERC on the difference between the existing mortgage capital balance and the new mortgage balance.
- The completion of the new mortgage must be simultaneous with redemption of this loan. If the mortgage redeems earlier, the ERC will be payable.
If you meet the above conditions and completion takes place on the same day as redemption, we may deduct the ERC from the redemption monies due.
Completion must be simultaneous, so you'll also need to submit the Certificate of Title for the new mortgage to tmw-completions@themortgageworks.co.uk . See our Certificate of Title section for more information.
To notify us of the death of a customer and to obtain date of death figures, you'll need to use the following contact details:
Northampton Administration Centre Kings Park Road Moulton Park Northampton, NN3 6NW
Contact number: 0345 606 40 60
Please make sure to provide a copy of the death certificate or other evidence of the death, such as a coroner’s interim certificate.
If the deceased customer held joint accounts, we'll transfer these into the remaining account holder’s name.
You'll need your panel number for The Mortgage Works to request a redemption statement on behalf of your client. If you’re not on our panel, you can tell us your Solicitor Regulation Authority (SRA) number. You can also register for the panel via Lender Exchange.
Complete the statement request form (opens in a new window) , and we'll send it to you by email. It can take up to five working days.
You can request to have the redemption statement dated up to 30 days in advance of the day you want it. It will be valid for 30 days, or until your client makes a payment (such as their regular monthly payment or an overpayment). This will change the amount required to redeem the mortgage.
After the 30 days, you can use the daily rate of interest (DRI) included on the redemption statement to work out the additional amount that needs to be added to the redemption figure to redeem the mortgage in full.
We no longer charge Early Repayment Charges (ERCs) for clients redeeming their mortgage in the last month of their product term. We'll review any pipeline Redemption requests in line with this change as part of the account closure process. We'll issue a refund if due.
We use the Electronic Discharge (ED) process to redeem our registered charges in England and Wales.
An ED is a discharge of a registered charge sent electronically by a lender direct to Land Registry. Land Registry's computer system makes a number of checks. If everything is in order, it cancels the charge entries. In most cases, the charge entries will be instantly and automatically cancelled on receipt of the discharge.
The difference between an ED and an electronic notification of discharge (END)
An END is an electronic message to Land Registry authorising the cancellation of the charge entries. To cancel the charge you must combine it with a formal application to Land Registry to discharge the charge. When the Land Registry receive the application, their staff will cancel the entries relating to the discharge.
An ED cancels the charge entries automatically and, in most cases, immediately. It does not require a separate formal paper application to discharge the charge. It is a computer to computer, system driven process so does not require manual intervention.
The reason Land Registry introduced EDs
For e-conveyancing, there is a requirement to have a system of discharging registered charges automatically. Although EDs can operate effectively solely for discharges, it will form part of an integrated e-conveyancing system.
EDs will overcome some of the problems related with DS1s and ENDs, especially the inherent delays. We have introduced new processes, which automate and speed up the way we deal with redemptions.
What to do if you act for a borrower
We will tell you in the redemption statement that we intend to discharge a charge by an ED. You must tell us which charges you will be redeeming. You will need to pay off the charge in the normal way. Provided we receive the correct payment, and it is a case to be discharged by an ED, we will send an ED to the Registry. If accepted, the registry will cancel the charge entries automatically. We will then write to you to confirm that the charge has been successfully discharged.
If there is another party involved, you will need to agree on a revised form of undertaking. This is to allow for the electronic discharge.
What to do if you act for a buyer
You should proceed with the transaction in the same way as you would with any other. The only exception is that you will need to allow for the different method of discharge by agreeing on a revised form of undertaking. For example the seller's conveyancer will send the moneys required to discharge the charge and to inform you when the charge has been discharged. Or to provide you with a DS1 if the lender has been unable to transmit an ED or an END. The arrangements for completion should be no different from normal, except for the modified undertaking.
The undertaking you should use
On both the Law Society for England & Wales' website‚ and Land Registry's e-conveyancing website you can find the suggested form of undertaking:
- www.lawsociety.org.uk (opens in a new window)
- www.landregistry.gov.uk (opens in a new window)
How quickly will you deal with redemptions?
We'll send an ED to Land Registry within five working days of receiving the redemption moneys. All parties are determined to ensure that you don't get the same delays experienced with DS1s and END with ED. We have agreed to adhere to specified time standards for transmitting an ED.
Are there any situations when Land Registry's computer will not cancel the charge entries?
There may be occasions when it would be wrong to cancel the charge entries automatically. For example, there might be an application pending at Land Registry against the title concerned. Before cancelling the charge entry, you would have to complete it first. In this situation, Land Registry will accept the ED. However, they won't cancel the charge entries until the prior application has been completed. We will tell you if this situation occurs.
Will an ED be accepted on all occasions?
There may be a few situations when they may reject an ED. If Land Registry don't accept an ED, they will inform us instantly. Land Registry will then investigate the reason why the ED has been rejected and use an alternative method for discharging the charge. The Mortgage Works will send an END. It is not necessary for you to send us and END form for these charges.
Can other lenders use this system?
Other lenders will be allowed to discharge their charges by EDs. Before they can do so, they will have to go through a process called Data Synchronization. This is to make sure that their charge data matches with the Land Registry's. They'll need to guarantee to deal with redemptions within five working days.
Is the system secure?
All EDs are sent via secure "virtual private networks". There has been a number of security features included to ensure that only authorised lenders can send EDs. We can only discharge our own charges or charges authorised for other lenders.
Need further information
Land Registry has published a Practice Bulletin (No.6 – Electronic Discharges). This is available on their website or from any Land Registry office.
How to register
To register to be on our panel you'll need to apply through Lender Exchange (opens in a new window).
Once you've provided your firms details, if you can see Nationwide or The Mortgage Works, then you meet our minimum requirements to apply.
If you're on our panel, but not registered on Lender Exchange, you can email any queries to solicitorspanel@nationwide.co.uk .
How to update
If you're on our panel and have registered on Lender Exchange you can update any details on the Lender Exchange (opens in a new window) website.
What is Lender Exchange?
This is a third party service used by lenders and solicitors across the industry. With Lender Exchange you can register, update details and receive important communications.
We require conveyancers to carry out all the usual and necessary searches and enquiries. A Local Authority Search protects both the applicant and ourselves as it can:
- reveal matters such as future development plans for an area
- reveal existing planning consent for another property close by
- flag whether the property is safe to live in
- flag if it requires remediation works.
Our instructions to Conveyancers in the UK Finance Mortgage Lenders' Handbook (opens in a new window) are:
- Non New Build property purchase transactions - we don’t accept search insurance, and we require a completed local search in all circumstances.
- Remortgage transactions - we don’t require a completed local search or require search insurance.
- New Build cases - if the local search carried out on the original plot of land has expired, we'll accept search insurance to cover any new risks that may have emerged. This is since the last time a local search completed.
This section aims to:
- support you in getting the application right first time.
- making the Limited Company registration a smooth process with Companies House.
- and avoid delays for your client.
Please note: your client must have registered their company in England, Wales or Scotland.
1.	Completing a MR01 form
- You can download the guidance on completing paper form Particulars of a charge (MR01)- (PDF, 99KB - opens in a new window) . This will guide you through the form completion process in nine steps. It’s important you make sure you’re completing this form. And not the 'LL MR01 for a Limited Liability Partnership' form.
2.	Submitting MRO1, the Mortgage Deed and a fee
- Companies House online filing service (opens in a new window) is the quickest way to submit the MR01 to register the charge.
- You may need to register for this service the first time you use it.
- Please ensure you include a copy of the Mortgage Deed , along with the required fee.
Companies House can't keep hold of an incomplete application or contact you to request missing documents. Make sure to package and submit the required documents together to ensure your application isn't rejected.
3.	Certified written instrument
- You must accompany the MR01 form with a certified copy of the Mortgage Deed signed by the company entering into the charge.
- Companies House will retain it and make it available for the public register. It’s important you don't submit the original Mortgage Deed.
4.	Timings
- You must complete point two within 21 days. This will begin with the day after the day you created the charge. For example, you'll need to deliver a Companies House charge dated 8 January by 29 January.
5.	Errors in application
- If the form contains errors, Companies House are likely to reject it and return it to you.
6.	Land Registry
- Once the registration has been completed at Companies House, you should then proceed to register the charge at Land Registry. This must be within the priority period afforded by the original 'Official Search priority' application.
Download the form and guides below or visit our Companies House website (opens in a new window) to find out more information.

### Using the system

How to amend your submitted application
After a full application has been submitted, it’s not possible to make amendments to the case via TMW Online. Once the case has been assigned an Application ID and you wish to make a material change, please email tmw.applications@themortgageworks.co.uk to request any changes.
How to change a product
If the full application hasn’t been fully submitted, it’s possible to resubmit the DIP and select an alternative product.
If the application has been submitted, please contact the updates team by emailing tmw.applications@themortgageworks.co.uk .
For like for like port applications, you may be asked to select a new product if the requested total loan amount is higher than the existing loan amount entered. You'll need to revisit the loan requirements.
How to print case documentation
For a submitted mortgage application:
- Search for the case you require from the TMW Online home page and click 'Open case' which will open the case tracking screen.
- All documentation generated for the case will be available on the case tracking screen.
Click on the relevant document to open and print.
For mortgage applications that have not yet been submitted, you can access documentation via the Documents link on the DIP and full mortgage application screens.
Our Contact us page has all the information you need if you have a pre or post application query.
Reserving a product
To reserve a product, you will need to complete and submit the full mortgage application paying any applicable fees for the product selected.
How can I access my colleague’s case?
You'll be unable to access the case online, however you can obtain further updates on the case by contacting the updates team on 0345 605 40 40 , then press option 2.
Non Standard Tenancy Agreement
The standard form of letting agreement we accept is an Assured Shorthold Tenancy, or either a Short Assured Tenancy, Occupation Contract in Wales or a Private Residential Tenancy in Scotland. Where this isn’t used, we’ll consider this a non standard tenancy.
We accept the following tenant types on a non standard tenancy basis:
- Corporate Tenancy – A company is the tenant for the purposes of housing one of its employees and associated family. The tenant company must employ a minimum of 1,000 people and we won’t consider any sub-letting arrangements.
- Local Authority/Housing Association Tenancy
- A private tenant where the rent is greater than £100,000 and therefore falls outside the limits of an Assured Shorthold Tenancy.
In line with standard tenancy agreements, the solicitor is responsible for checking the terms of the tenancy are acceptable to us, based on our lender information displayed in the UK Finance Handbook. The maximum term of 36 months also applies (except in the case of a Private Residential Tenancy which does not have a fixed term).
My client has lived at multiple addresses in the last 3 years. Can I submit their case online?
You can provide up to 9 previous addresses for your client, although additional information may be required in some cases.
If you get an error message
If you get an error message when keying a Let to Buy application this is most likely caused by trying to submit Let to Buy applications as a purchase.
Please check the application has been submitted as a remortgage. If you’re still receiving an error message, please contact us using .

### Packaging support case requirements

You need to submit your client's case requirements after you've received our confirmation email at the Full Mortgage Application (FMA) stage. You can upload these to TMW Online using our scan and attach facility - you don't need to email or post supporting documents.
Once the full mortgage application has been submitted, you can find a list of case requirements on the 'valuation and assessment' section within the case tracking screen.
The case requirements will be confirmed to you within your DIP response and also when you submit the full mortgage application.
We’ll only ask for additional information for complex cases where it’s necessary for us to make a decision.
If your client needs to provide case requirements you've already submitted, you can tell us the FMA reference number for the case requirements you’ve already sent and we’ll match them up. Alternatively you can resend these quoting the new Full Mortgage Application (FMA) reference number.
Back to top

### Producing a Mortgage Illustration

You must have created a case before producing a Mortgage Illustration.
You'll be given the option of creating a Mortgage Illustration once a case has been created, and again as part of the product section of the full mortgage application. Once generated, Mortgage Illustrations are saved to the case which can be accessed via the Documents link throughout DIP and full mortgage application.
When the full mortgage application has been submitted, you'll also be able to view the Mortgage Illustration via case tracking.
Back to top

### 

For a TMW online case, you'll be able to retrieve your DIP certificate directly from the DIP response screen. If you wish to access the DIP certificate after this point, it'll be available via the Documents link throughout the full mortgage application. When the full mortgage application has been submitted, you'll also be able to view the certificate via case tracking.
Amending a DIP
You can amend details on the DIP (excluding applicant personal details), at any time prior to submission of the full application. This can be done by clicking 'Amend DIP' from the DIP response screen or 'Back to DIP' at any point during the full mortgage application. Rather than submitting another DIP, you can amend the existing DIP by following the steps in the 'how can I amend a DIP' question.
If you amend details on the DIP, you will lose your current DIP decision status and will need to re-run through the DIP pages, amend and resubmit.
Once you've done this and received an 'accept', the new DIP certificate can be viewed within the Documents link throughout the full mortgage application. When the full mortgage application has been submitted, you'll also be able to view the certificate via case tracking.
Another footprint won't be left with the Credit Reference Agency / Bureau if it's within 60 days of the original DIP.
If you need to speak to us, you either call our Mortgage New Business Team on 0345 605 40 40 then press option 2 or 3 or email dip@themortgageworks.co.uk .
Back to top

### Credit Reference Agencies/Bureaus

For the assessment of lending risk, we use the three major UK credit reference agencies and bureaus:
- Equifax
- TransUnion
- Experian
We’ll search at least one agency for an application. If we require additional information or don’t get an exact match we’ll search the other agencies.
All lenders are required to leave a footprint highlighting when they've performed a search connected with mortgage lending. If we have to use more than one Credit Reference Agency or Bureau, we're required to leave a footprint at each agency used.
Please note: The Mortgage Works will only carry out searches which leave a hard footprint .

# General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a piece of legislation that has replaced the Data Protection Act 1998. It has enhanced and strengthened individual rights, increased compliance obligations and expanded investigative and enforcement powers for The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) .
GDPR impacts how companies collect, store and use customers personal data as well as the controls and governance around these activities. The principles of data protection remains similar to the previous legislation but places more focus on the accountability of the  organisation. This gives individuals more control around the handling of their personal information. This includes new rights to help people understand how we use their data and how to manage their data privacy.
Customers will have the right to:
- object to the processing of personal information any further
- ask to obtain the information held about them or transfer a copy to another provider
- request to have any incorrect information, corrected
- request the removal of all data we hold. This right isn’t absolute and only applies in certain circumstances.
Our fair processing notices and terms of business comply with the GDPR. As part of the application process, you’ll be asked to ensure that your client has seen and understood ‘ How we use your information ’.
The GDPR defines personal data as any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“data subject”). An identifiable natural person is one who is identified, directly or indirectly.
In particular by reference to an identifier such as :
- a name
- an identification number
- location data
- an online identifier
- one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.
Personal data includes :
- Personal details
- Family and lifestyle details
- Education and training
- Medical details
- Employment details
- Financial details
- Contractual details (goods and services provided to a data subject for example)
- Genetic, biometric and health data
- Online identifiers (IP addresses, cookies).
You can send information relating to applications to us by uploading the documents to the case in TMW Online . If you need to send an email or documents containing personal data outside NFI Online, you should ensure it's encrypted. Contact us on if you need to do this.

## Special category data

There is a subset of personal data known as ‘special category data’. This is personal data deemed more sensitive under the GDPR and so requires greater safety measures to ensure its protection.
Examples of special category data include :
- Racial or ethnic origin
- Political opinion
- Religious beliefs or other beliefs of a similar nature
- Trade Union membership
- Physical or mental health or condition
- Sexual life
- Biometrics
The GDPR defines these terms as the following:
Data subject: an individual who is the subject of personal data.
Data controller: a person who (either alone or jointly or in common with other persons) determines the purpose and manner in which any personal data are, or are to be, processed.
Data processor (In relation to personal data): a person (other than an employee of the data controller) who processes the data on behalf of the data controller.
The intermediary is acting as an independent Data Controller in respect of the personal data that they capture and process as part of their advice activities. They will input data into our systems for processing once the customer selects the mortgage works product. This is on a Data Controller to Data Controller basis. This is because neither party is processing personal data for the other and each is determining the purpose of the processing of that data. This is to introduce the business and obtain a procuration fee and the servicing of those customers.
Where the intermediary passes data over to us and we're considering whether to lend to a customer, The Mortgage Works and the intermediary are acting as a Data Controller. We'll be processing the data for its own purposes to determine whether to lend or not. This is irrespective of whether this is at DIP or FMA stage. The intermediary is submitting that data to The Mortgage Works for its own purposes and not under our instructions. The intermediary will remain a Data Controller.
We'll review our Terms and Conditions and will continue to monitor and make changes where it sees fit. We’re not looking to make explicit changes to our contracts with members.
You/your client can access information in any of the following ways:
- Access our new web-form
- Advise your client to visit their local Nationwide branch
- Advise your client to contact the call centre
Where it’s identified there’s a potential breach, this must be reported to the ICO within 72 hours. For high risk breaches, you must notify any impacted individuals.
Failure to notify a breach, when required to do so could result in:
- A fine of up to £20 million or 4% of the company’s global annual turnover of the previous financial year, whichever is higher.
For full details on GDPR, please visit the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) website .

# Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement

The Mortgage Works (UK) plc is a wholly owned subsidiary of Nationwide Building Society ( Nationwide ).
As a member of Nationwide’s group, The Mortgage Works relies on its parent, Nationwide, for the infrastructure and resources it needs to carry on its business. This includes providing or acquiring all the goods and services, IT and other technology The Mortgage Works needs to run its business. It also includes providing The Mortgage Works staff.
The Mortgage Works does not source the supply of goods and services for itself but relies on Nationwide’s activities for the wider group. The Mortgage Works supply chains are, effectively, Nationwide’s supply chains. The Mortgage Works is subject to, and benefits from, Nationwide’s group policies on slavery and human trafficking.
The Mortgage Works relies on the steps of its parent, Nationwide, to take on its behalf and on behalf of all the Nationwide group in tackling the risk of modern slavery taking place in its business or supply chains. This is reflected in Nationwide’s Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement which describes those steps in more detail. The Statement is published on Nationwide’s website.

# EU Mortgage Credit Directive

The Mortgage Credit Directive (MCD) introduced an EU-wide framework of conduct rules for mortgage activities. It's created minimum regulatory requirements that all member states must comply with to provide consistency in protecting consumers taking out credit agreements for residential property. For the Buy to Let (BTL) market, EU MCD has resulted in the creation of a Consumer BTL regulatory status.
For The Mortgage Works, the Consumer BTL regulatory status applies to a borrower with no other let properties wishing to obtain a mortgage on a property that has either been inherited or has previously been occupied by the borrower or related person at any time
This means the status will apply to the following application types:
- where the borrower or a family member has previously lived in the property, typically Let to Buy
- inherited properties.
If the borrower lets any other property at the time of the application, they won’t be classed as a consumer, even if the points above apply. This regulatory determination will only apply to remortgage applications.
When completing an application, unaffected borrowers will be asked to sign a declaration, confirming that they’re aware their mortgage will remain unregulated.

## Eligibility for a consumer BTL loan

The Mortgage Works definition of a Consumer BTL borrower is “A borrower with no other let properties wishing to obtain a mortgage on a property that has either been inherited or has previously been occupied by the borrower or related person at any time”.
TMW Online will identify whether the application is a Consumer BTL loan through the questions you are asked during the application process. You must ensure these questions are answered accurately to ensure that the correct regulatory status is applied.
If your clients’ application is a joint application, then as long as one of the applicants are identified as a consumer using the definition above, it’ll be classed as a Consumer BTL loan.
The following FCA permissions are required to submit applications to The Mortgage Works:
- advising on regulated mortgage contracts
- agreeing to carry on a regulated activity
- arranging (bringing about) regulated mortgage contacts
- debt counselling (if you are submitting an application involving Debt Consolidation and Additional Borrowing)
- to submit Consumer BTL applications, you’ll need to sign up to the FCA’s new Consumer BTL register.
We won’t be able to proceed with Consumer BTL applications received from firms who aren’t on this register, so we’d strongly encourage any intermediary firms to sign up.

## Foreign currency loans

EU MCD has introduced changes to the way foreign currency loans are defined, processed and managed. We don’t support foreign currency lending to new borrowers, including where the income derived from the property is paid to the borrower in a foreign currency.

## Submitting a consumer BTL

We hope we’ve covered most of the common questions. If you're still unsure you can contact one of our experienced advisers on .
