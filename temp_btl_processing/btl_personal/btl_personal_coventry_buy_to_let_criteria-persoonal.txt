Borrowers with four or more mortgaged Buy to Let properties (including personal buy to let, and/or where applicants are named as a director/shareholder/persons of significant control (PSC) on a limited company BTL mortgage) either together or separately, in aggregate, should be treated as portfolio landlords.

Applicants must have a minimum ICR of for the whole portfolio using the applicable reference rate irrespective of product types across all properties within the portfolio - the calculation should also include any unencumbered properties. A combined ICR of 145% will need to be achieved by personally owned properties and a combined ICR of 125% will need to be achieved by properties owned via a limited company.

No individual property within the portfolio should have an ICR of less than 100%. Where there is a property not currently tenanted (e.g. due to a void period), the ICR must be calculated based upon the estimated rent (from applicant declaration, providing the rental void period has been less than two months).

Where the rental void period has been two months or more an explanation should be obtained from the applicant.

We assess all the properties in the portfolio in all cases. This means that you must provide us with information that includes the value of each mortgage, monthly mortgage repayments, monthly rental amounts and estimated property values. You ll also need to give us full details of any unencumbered BTL properties.

There should be a maximum LTV of 65% across the whole portfolio. This calculation will include properties that are unencumbered and the property they re applying for.

No single property should be below an ICR of 100% (based on applicable reference rate).

Portfolio landlords must have acquired their first BTL property more than 24 months before the current application. No more than three properties (prior to the current application) should have been acquired within the last 12 months.

The dedicated BTL portfolio underwriting team will also review the portfolio to consider geographical exposure and property management risk. For example the number of properties in the same block of flats or street, and how properties are managed.
