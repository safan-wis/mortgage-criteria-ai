All residential mortgages should be repaid before the eldest applicant’s 76th birthday. Underwriters will consider repayment before the eldest applicant’s 85th birthday.
If any element of the mortgage loan is interest only, the mortgage will need to be repaid before the eldest applicant’s 70th birthday. 
For joint borrowers, where the term extends beyond the oldest borrower’s 76th birthday, the underwriter must be satisfied that the loan is still affordable following the death of either borrower. 
 
Buy to let mortgage applications including holiday lets
Applicants should be 21 years old or older. 
All buy to let / holiday let mortgages should be repaid before the eldest applicant’s 85th birthday.
 
Retired applicants 
If lending is past the age of 70 or the applicant's intended retirement age (whichever comes first), the following applies:

If retirement is more than 10 years away, and the term does not extend beyond age 75 then we will use current income for affordability purposes, as long as the customer can prove they are paying into a private pension (payslip, bank statement or pension statement accepted). 
In all other circumstances affordability is reliant on a projected pension income. 
For joint borrowers, where the term extends beyond the oldest borrower’s 76th birthday, the underwriter must be satisfied that the loan is still affordable following the death of either borrower. 

For more, search for lending into retirement.

Holiday lets
Holiday lets
Property
We consider non-regulated holiday let applications on an advised basis. 

We will accept applications from applicants who do not currently own and live in their own home.

Applicants: 

Should be 21 years old or older
Should have no more than 2 mortgaged holiday lets, whether in sole or joint names including the current application. 
There is no minimum income requirement.

The maximum LTV for a holiday let mortgage is 75% with the minimum property value and purchase price of £50,000 and a minimum loan size at £25,000.

Loan-to-Value	Minimum loan size	Maximum Loan Size
Loan-to-Value 60%	£25,000	£1,000,000
Loan-to-Value 75%	£25,000	£750,000 
For different lending scenarios, we will require as rental coverage:

If the application is a £4£ re-mortgage on a property purchased on a holiday lets basis before January 2017, we will require 125% @ 7.80% as rental coverage. 
If the application is a £4£ re-mortgage on a property purchased on a holiday lets basis after January 2017, we will require 145% @ 7.80% as rental coverage.

Rental income is calculated using an average of the projected low, mid and high season weekly rental yields.

This is usually multiplied by an assumed occupancy level of 30 weeks and divided by 12 months. This is then applied to the rental coverage calculation. 

The calculation is £15,000 / 12 months = £1,250 monthly rental. £1,250 / 1.45 = £862.07 / 0.0780 = £11,052.18. £11,052.18 x 12 gives a maximum lend of £132,626

For example

High season £700, Mid season - £500, Low season - £300,  Season Average = £500
Multiplied by 30 weeks ÷ 12mths = £1,250
Rental coverage calculation (RCC) is £1,250 ÷ 1.45 = £862.07
RCC divided by current stress rate is £862.07 ÷ 0.0780 = £11,052.18
RCC multiplied by 12 months is £11,052.18 x 12 = £132,626
Maximum lend value = £132,626
Applicants can stay in the property for up to 2 months per annum.
