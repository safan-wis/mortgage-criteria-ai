We will need the details of the personal current account where the mortgage will be paid from at application stage. Business current accounts can't be used.

You don't need to complete the Direct Debit mandate form, but we need the account number and sort code to issue a mortgage offer.

You must obtain proof of income, deposit, gross monthly rent, and identification from everyone named on the mortgage before keying the application.

You should retain on file the following documentation for all BTL and LTB applications and submit upon request:

We require either of the following to be kept on file for the subject property, for all cases:

In addition we may still request the following for some cases:

You can find detailed guides on what documents can and can't be accepted in the relevant sections on this page.

• Latest Payslip
• If commission/overtime/bonus received, latest 3 monthly or 6 weekly payslips averaged and annualised.

• Latest 2 years SA302 tax calculation and tax year overviews
• Full accounts
• The latest year must not be older than 18 months from date of application.

• Latest bank statement showing gross pension credited
• Latest annual statement
• Latest P60

• Up to latest 2 years SA302 tax calculations and tax year overviews if available.
• This documentation is required for all customers who have existing BTL properties and rental income declared on application.
• Latest year must not be older than 18 months old.

• Tenancy Agreement   current, in date and signed by tenants, landlord or letting agent
• Letter from Letting Agent   confirming the named parties, current tenancy term and monthly rent

• SA105 Rental Property Form
• Latest 3 months bank statements
• Evidence of gross rent for other properties owned by the client. If we need this, we will ask for it to be provided before the case completes
• All evidenced income sources must be recorded on the application.
• Applicants may have different sources of income from employed PAYE, Self-Employment, Profit from UK Land and Property, Pension, and Gross Monthly Rental Income, they all need to be recorded separately and accurately on the application form, with evidence held on file, and submitted upon request.

Any application involving a fee paid to a third party, such as an investment club, for finding or introducing a buyer aren't acceptable.

This doesn't include the normal fee or commission payable to an estate agent handling the sale.

The first monthly payment is always collected in the month following completion of the mortgage. For example, if a mortgage completes in June, the first payment will be collected in July.

The payment will normally be collected on the customer's chosen monthly payment date. However, if their mortgage completes in the last few days of the month and there are fewer than four working days until the customer's chosen payment date, the first payment will be collected on 10th of that month.

This date will then revert to the customer's chosen payment date on the following month.

The first monthly payment includes an amount of 'initial interest' from the day of completion to the end of that month, plus the first monthly mortgage payment. For example, if completion is on the 15th, interest is calculated from the 15th to the end of the month and added to the first payment.

We'll write to all customers to tell them when we'll collect their monthly payments and let them know their first payment might be different to their normal monthly payments.

Free conveyancing for remortgaging to us is available on most of our remortgage products. Where your customer uses our remortgage service, we'll pay their conveyancer's legal fees and any registration fees.

Your customer will have to pay any fees their existing lender might charge for repaying their current mortgage.

These include your customers' existing lender's conveyancer's fees if the existing lender doesn't allow our conveyancer to act for them too.

If a customer chooses a product without free conveyancing or uses their own conveyancer, the conveyancer must be on our panel. Your customer must pay any legal charges, search fees, and registration fees or other costs even if they don't go ahead with the remortgage. The insurance search won't be available.

There might also be other costs to consider, including:

The remortgage service is also available for customers raising capital on a mortgage-free property.

Northern Irish customers

Northern Irish law means solicitors appointed by the lender can't provide any additional services to the customer. So, if a customer needs any additional services, they'll need to instruct another solicitor.

Scottish Properties - closure of Sasine register

The General Register of Sasine closed to standard securities on 01 April 2016. This change only affects remortgaging of Scottish properties on the old Sasine register.

As part of our commitment to make things easier, we'll cover the standard costs for transferring from the Sasine register to the Land Registry during the conveyancing part of our remortgage service, wherever possible.

We won't cover all transactions as part of this service if we think they're too complex. For these complex cases, the conveyancer should discuss the additional fees with the customer.

Complex transactions include, but aren't limited to:

These are high-level examples considered by conveyancer panel firms as the most likely to happen but aren't the only examples. The specific costs associated with complex transactions will vary. Panel firms will apply an hourly rate and agree everything with customers before starting any complex transaction.

• Transfer of equity.
• Purchasing an additional tranche.
• Additional TTs where a cashback is involved.
• Second charges.
• Possessory title.
• Unregistered land.
• Leasehold properties.

• Plans report shows either an overlap or shortfall between the legal and occupational extent.
• The title is complex with split-off writs, exceptions, and additions that need a full examination to draft the security and obtain a relevant deed plan.
• The property is a flat or part of a tenement block with common parts where obtaining neighbouring titles would be needed.
• Rural properties where copies of neighbouring titles are needed to check servitudes/access rights etc.

All let to buy applications must involve a related residential purchase. We'll only accept applications where customers are intending to rent out their current residential home, so they can buy another residential home.

If the customer is taking a new residential mortgage when purchasing a new home we will need to see a copy of the new residential offer before we can issue the LTB offer.

If the customers are buying a new property without a mortgage or the new residential lender is unable to issue the offer we'll need a letter addressed to BM Solutions from the conveyancer dated within three months of the application to confirm:

We can't issue a let to buy offer until we've received everything we need.

• the future residential address
• the purchase price
• if the property will or won't have a mortgage.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


## Customer

All customers must be fully and properly identified as part of the mortgage application process.

Accurate information must be recorded on our application system, including confirmation of whether this is a face-to-face or non-face-to-face application.

If the customer doesn't pass our electronic verification checks, you'll need to certify and retain evidence of the customer's identification documents.

The documents you can accept depend on whether you've met with the customer in person, or remotely by telephone or video.

Here's a guide to understanding what documents you'll need.

Single ID&V

For face-to-face verification, where the customer is physically present and documentation is taken and verified, one document from the single identification list can be used to verify the customer.

Single ID can't be used if the customer isn't present when ID&V is collected. This includes video interviews. In this case, use the standard ID&V process.

Single ID&V documents:

These documents can be accepted in a former name with evidence of the name change, such as a marriage certificate, Deed Poll or Decree Absolute.

Standard ID&V

Standard ID&V must be followed when the customer isn't present when ID&V is obtained, or the customer doesn't have a single ID document.

The customer will need to produce two separate documents. These must be originals and can only be used once in the process for either address verification or identification.

FCA registered firms must make sure any documentation relied upon to verify a customer's identify is copied, certified, and retained in accordance with money laundering regulations. We reserve the right to contact you and request copies of identity documents at any time during the life of the mortgage and for up to five years after cessation.

• UK photo card driving licence, showing the customer's current address.

For EEA/Swiss nationals with Settled or Pre settled status, the 'Share code' can used as residence.

• The customer (or at least one customer on a joint or multiple application) has lived continuously in the UK for more than 5 years
• To determine if a customer has lived in the UK for more than five years we will use data provided by credit reference agencies

Only identification and address verification and right to reside documents need to be certified.

You must certify the documents when they're collected and keep copies on file. You don't need to upload copies to the application unless we ask you to.

Certifying documents

Documents must be certified by an FCA-registered mortgage intermediary. Certification should include:

The certifier must also add written confirmation on the document. Suggested wording for this is:

'I certify this is a true and correct copy of the original document as sighted by me'. You can use your own variation of this if you prefer.

Separate 'certificates' are acceptable. These are sometimes called ID verification header sheets, broker/adviser verification checklists or similar.

• Certifier's signature, name, and job title.

• Details on the certificate must match those of the ID&V documents provided.

## Income

Affordability is assessed using the anticipated rental income from the property. We'll also assess personal income when making a lending decision, so it's important the customer's income is keyed accurately as it might affect the decision.

When doing this, we expect to see the customer can afford their personal commitments, so we can be confident our lending decision is sustainable if the tenant stops paying or the property needs any maintenance or repairs. An application might be declined if our assessment shows there's not enough disposable income to support the borrowing and the customer's personal commitments.

In our rental cover calculation, we want the customer to have more rent coming in than the normal mortgage payment, so the situations mentioned earlier can be covered.

We'll also take the additional cost of increased tax liability for some customers into account.

We understand personal income might not fully reflect the overall financial picture for the applicant. They could have other assets and savings, for example. We also know the buy to let might be in a single name, but personal financial commitments could be held jointly with someone else.

Some of the information we might need to manually underwrite an application, includes:

Learn more about:

Tax on rental income

Income types

• How the customer manages their commitments.
• How they've built up any reserves, including the deposit.
• Whether they have previous experience of buying to let
• The rationale for sole applications, where finances are joint.
• Business details for self-employed customers.

Foreign currency income is any income other than sterling received by a customer. Foreign currency income paid into a UK bank account and transferred to sterling is still considered to be foreign currency.

Foreign currency income won't be accepted for new mortgage or remortgage applications for new and existing customers, including porting, transfers of mortgaged property (TOMP), and further advances.

The only exceptions to this are further advance applications for essential repairs to the mortgaged property and product transfers.

If your customer is classed as employed, they'll need to have been in their current role for at least three months.

If your customer is classed as self-employed, we'll need at least two years' worth of trading figures.

Sub-contractors, fixed/short term contracts, and agency workers

We'll consider applications from these customers if they have continuous employment of 12 months or more with six months of the contract remaining, or the customer has two years' continuous service in the same type of employment. Evidence of their employment record might be needed.

IT and other contractors

For IT contractors on any income and other contractors whose income is more than  500 per day or  75,000 per annum, whether employed or self-employed, we accept the gross value of the contract as evidence of income. All applicants must have a current continuous employment of 12 months or more with six months of the contract remaining or two years continuous service in the same type of employment.

The customer should be treated as self-employed if they have more than one contract, or where they've set up a limited company and employ other contractors.

Construction Industry Scheme Contractors (CIS)

For these customers, they'll need to provide an average of their latest 3 months income. They should be treated as self-employed if they pay their own tax or sub-contract to more than one company.

Zero-hours contracts

Applications from customers employed on a zero-hours contract will be considered. We'll only take income from the total of the last 12 calendar months into account income. Applicants will have to verify their income.

Professional sports people

Professional sports people will have to confirm they've either been in continuous employment for 12 months or more with six months of the contract remaining, or two years' continuous service as at the date of application in the same type of employment.

It's essential to verify these customers will be able to meet their monthly repayments as they near the end of their career or if their career's ended early because of injury.

Additional information:

Length of employment/self-employment

Income types

Self-employed applicants

For all applications, at least one of the customers' needs to have an earned income and/or pension income. All income sources must be recorded accurately. This includes all full years of self-employed income, PAYE, pension income, and all gross monthly rental. All income sources need to be within the UK.

For employed, self-employed, and retired customers, all rental income and finance costs captured in the 'Land and property income' section of the application should match the customers' tax calculations from HMRC. You can find how to key this in our Hints & tips PDF (3.1MB).

To key a customer whose only source of income is from land and property

Select 'Occupation type' as 'Professional' and 'Employment type' as 'Self-Employed'.

You'll need to input a year end date and figures for their most recent and previous years. The most recent date can't be older than 18 months from the date of submission.

The remaining figures for net profit, turnover, gross profit, current assets, and current liabilities must be input as ' 0'. Complete the 'Self-employment details' - including business name and accountant details - and the 'Add employment' section. The land and property profit figures from the tax calculation will then need to be entered into the land and property income section.

Any finance costs for the latest year will also need to be entered. The finance costs are referenced at the bottom of the tax calculation, as well on the individual's self-assessment tax return, and property income supplement (SA105).

For 'Can income be verified?', you must answer 'Yes'.

For all remortgages and further advances

The current rental amount of the property should be keyed on the application as the current monthly rent paid by the tenant.

For a buy to let purchase and let to buy remortgage

The current rental amount keyed will be the anticipated monthly rent of the property.

The gross monthly rent will need to be keyed into the property schedule screen for all buy to let properties owned by anyone named on the application.

A tenancy agreement or letter from the letting agent can be used to verify the rental income keyed in the Property schedule screen.

Online tax assessments from accountants' commercial software, accompanied by the corresponding tax year overviews are acceptable as long as they show:

The tax due figure on the tax calculation and tax year overview will usually match. If there is a difference in the tax figure, we might need updated documents.

The latest two years' full accounts must be finalised and clearly show the net profit for sole traders, the share of net profit for partnerships, or salary and dividends for directors of limited companies.

Profit and loss statements alone aren't acceptable.

The year end for all documents must be the most recent and not be dated more than 18 months before the date of application.

Finance costs are not tax deductible, but tax relief can be claimed at the basic rate, whatever rate of tax the customer pays. This will mean an increased tax liability for some landlords. Where applications are referred for manual review, we'll consider the additional tax liability.

Customers must get independent tax advice if they're unsure how the tax rules will affect them.

Assignable contracts allow the original buyer to sell the property before legal completion, by assigning the contract to buy the property to a new buyer after contracts have been exchanged with the developer.

We can't accept applications involving assignable contracts or irrevocable powers of attorney in favour of intervening sellers. Any similar transaction structure must be reported to us.

Mortgage arrears

We offer business buy to lets (BBTL) and consumer buy to lets (CBTL).

A BBTL is a mortgage used to buy or remortgage a property to let to a non-family member or where the majority of the borrowing is for BTL purposes.

A CBTL is where the property wasn't originally purchased for letting, and the customer doesn't let out any other properties. The customer or a family member might have previously lived in the property, for example.

And/or

BBTL mortgages are not regulated and a CBTL mortgage is regulated by the HM Treasury. You'll need Consumer FCA permissions before submitting any CBTL applications.

Customer answers will establish whether the loan is classified as a BBTL or CBTL.

Loan purpose is vital in deciding whether lending will be unregulated BBTL or regulated CBTL. When applying for a remortgage with additional borrowing or a further advance, the loan purposes listed will be available online:

BBTL loan purpose

Consumer Goods/Funds

This list might not be available for every application. Availability of each loan purpose will depend on the circumstances of an individual application.

We don't accept concessionary purchase applications where the property is being purchased below full market value.

The only exception to this is the purchase of a new build property if the value has increased between agreement to purchase and building completion. Builder incentives are acceptable, subject to our existing criteria.

It's acceptable to purchase a BTL property from a family member, as long as the deposit is sourced from the applicant's own resources and the property is purchased at full market value. We can't accept gifted deposits, even if they're from a different family member to the customer.

BTL properties can't be let to a family member.

Additional information:

Builder cash incentives

Please answer 'Yes' to the credit history question if any customer has had a County Court Judgement (CCJ) or default registered against them, or their business if they're self-employed, within the last six years.

CCJs are generally considered in credit scoring. Background details will be need for the application.

Additional information:

Mortgage arrears

Bankruptcies

All applications will be credit scored. Customers have the right to appeal if an application is declined because it doesn't pass our credit scoring.

Here are the scenarios when an appeal might be successful:

Porting application with no additional borrowing

BFPO Address

The client is in the British Armed Forces and living at a BFPO address.

Victim of fraud

The fraud's been reported to the police and Credit Industry Fraud Avoidance system (CIFAS) and has its own a crime reference number.

Adverse credit data registered in error

An error by Lloyds Banking Group can be proven

If the adverse information has been registered on a non-Lloyds Banking Group product, an appeal can't be submitted. The customer should arrange for their credit file to be corrected before a new application is submitted.

For any scenario outside of these, it's unlikely we'll change our decision.

Read our credit scoring guide

A dependant is anyone who relies on your customer financially. They won't be included on the mortgage or contribute to the monthly payments.

Child and adult dependants need to be captured separately.

Child dependants

These are any children under 18 who the customers are the primary carer for. You should also include any children they're expecting or in the process of adopting. Foster children or any children who have an income they can fully support themselves with don't need to be included.

Child maintenance must be keyed as an outgoing commitment, but the child doesn't need to be included as a dependant.

Adult dependant

An adult dependant is someone not included in the mortgage but is financially reliant on the customer. This could be a spouse/partner, elderly relative, or any grown-up children in full-time education or unemployed.

If the adult dependant doesn't live at the property all of the time, still key this in the adult dependant section.

If the adult dependant doesn't ever live at the property, they must not be keyed as a dependant, but the related costs must be keyed as a total figure in 'Other commitments'.

The source of all customer deposits must be captured, and proof must be retained for all buy to let applications, other than remortgages.

The deposit should come from the customers' own resources. A builder's deposit of up to 5% of the purchase price is allowable on new build property applications if the LTV is 75% or less. The valuer must be aware of any incentive and make a note of it in the valuation report.

For certain applications, you'll need to verify the deposit. Evidence will also be needed if the application needs an underwriter review, and/or a message is displayed at DIP submission and the additional requirements section of the Submit application results screens at full application.

We can't accept the following as deposit sources:

We can accept the following as deposit sources, as long as they can be verified

Equity

Gift

Gifted deposits are only acceptable from family. They must be non-repayable. The property can't be let out to, or purchased from, a family member. Evidence of the source of deposit must be kept on record in all cases.

Purchases between family members are acceptable, as long as the property's sold at market value and the buyer is a UK resident. Deposits for these types of sale can't be gifted.

You'll need to provide a signed letter written by the donor within three months of the mortgage application

It must include:

It must confirm:

You must also provide the latest UK bank statement or passbook showing evidence of the deposit funds in the donor's or customers' UK bank account. Alternatively, a letter from the donor's or customers' UK bank confirming the funds are available can be provided.

Sole applications

The applicant must own a property in the UK in their own name. This will need to be validated before an offer can be made.

More than one applicant

At least one applicant must own a property in the UK in their own name. This will need to be validated before an offer can be made. All other named applicants can be first time buyers.

In most cases, we'll validate property ownership with a credit search on the applicant. If we can't do this or the property is unencumbered, we might ask for more evidence.

Acceptable documents:

England and Wales

Scotland and Northern Ireland

The property can be let on:

The minimum tenancy term is six months. The maximum tenancy term is normally 36 months. A maximum tenancy of five years is acceptable under a Dept for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC) model agreement of September 2014 (or as amended) or the Scottish Equivalent.

A BTL remortgage application can't be started without a tenant in place. A tenancy agreement must also be in place. If a tenancy is about to start, the applicant must have a tenancy agreement dated within 14 days of the application confirming the expected rental income.

The property can be let to a company on a corporate let. The maximum term for this is 12 months. Our consent isn't needed to renew the tenancy. But the occupiers need to be named on the tenancy and must be employees of the tenant company.

The maximum number of unrelated tenants is five. They must all be named on the agreement. It's the landlords' responsibility to make sure all legislation is complied with, including (but not restricted to) legislation relating to Tenancy Deposit schemes and HMOs (Houses in Multiple Occupation).

For larger properties, where there is a potential of more than five lettable rooms, the valuer must be satisfied the property and local market reflects single family letting arrangements.

Properties subject to Local Authority Homes in Multiple Occupation (HMO) licensing might be acceptable, subject to the valuer's assessment of suitability based on our requirements.

We can't accept tenants in the following categories:

The tenancy agreement must provide that assignment or sub-lettings to tenants in these categories are not allowed.

Letting criteria

Lending amounts are either assessed using actual or anticipated rental income from the property only using stress rates and rental cover ratios or top slicing where we will consider personal income alongside rental income.

Additional information:

A portfolio landlord application is where the applicants' have four or more mortgaged BTL properties, including the new transaction. This is based on the total number held by everyone named on the application.

Here's an example of how it works

Two applicants are buying a property together. Applicant 1 already has two mortgaged BTL properties, and applicant 2 has one mortgaged BTL property.

In total, they'll have four properties between them, including the one they're buying together, so the application is classified as a portfolio landlord.

Mortgaged BTL properties include those held in a personal name, limited company name, or any other legal entity.

Information needed includes:

Your application will not progress until all of the above has been fully completed - including completion of the portfolio details screen in the full application.

Portfolio landlords criteria

* Based on the entire portfolio, including acquiring property and any unencumbered let property.

Unencumbered let properties

These aren't included in the total mortgaged BTL properties. But the rent and property value must be declared in the property schedule and portfolio details sections of the application.

Since 06 April 2020, tax relief on finance costs for landlords of residential properties is restricted to basic rate of income tax, regardless of which tax band the landlord falls into. Accordingly, profit from land and property as it appears on a tax calculation no longer has finance costs deducted.

You'll need to input the latest year's finance costs on the application.

Examples of builder cash incentives include deposit contributions, cash-backs, contribution to legal fees/stamp duty, and mortgage subsidies.

Builder cash incentives are usually acceptable if their value isn't more than 5% of the lower of the purchase price or valuation. Cash incentives more than this might mean a lower maximum loan amount is available.

All builder cash incentives must be declared at the point of sale. All lending decisions are based on either the valuation or purchase price, whichever is lower.

Additional information:

New build

The buy to let property address must not be the same as the customers' correspondence address.

Properties in England and Wales

Properties in buildings five storeys or higher no longer need an External Wall System (EWS1) form in order to progress an application. We'll also consider applications on properties where cladding remediation work is needed but not yet completed.

EWS1 forms might still be needed for buildings four storeys or lower. The surveyor will advise when an External Wall System (EWS1) form is required to confirm the status of the external wall system and any applicable attachments e.g. balconies on multi occupied, multi storey buildings of any height.

Properties in Scotland and Northern Ireland

Will still need an EWS1 form regardless of height. Customers will have to source the EWS1 form themselves.

The building owner and/or agent is responsible for confirming an external wall system or attachments, such as a balcony, on buildings containing flats has been assessed by a suitable expert.

The EWS1 form must be prepared by a qualified independent professional. They must be a member of one of the professional bodies listed by RICS.

We can't confirm if a property is acceptable until a valuation has been instructed.

For purchase cases, a special condition will be added to a mortgage offer to instruct the conveyancer to advise the customer an offer has been made based on the information in an EWS1. It'll also make sure the customer knows neither us nor the surveyor are liable for information in the EWS1 form.

New build high rise blocks

In England and Wales, The Building (Amendment) Regulations 2018 or local equivalent can be used for new builds over six storeys or 18 metres high. A conveyancer will need to confirm this has been used by the building owner or agent.

This applies to new builds of four storeys or 11 metres high in Scotland.

If this can't be confirmed, please follow the EWS1 process.

The property must be habitable, readily lettable or saleable, and structurally sound.

Buildings insurance also needs to be able to be arranged on it.

The property must be in the UK under UK legal jurisdiction. Property acceptability is based on a satisfactory valuation report from the bank's appointed valuer.

Non-standard construction will be assessed on individual merit.

Certain types of pre-cast reinforced concrete (PRC) construction are classed as defective. We might not accept it unless it's been repaired.

We'll be guided by the suitability of all mortgage properties by the valuer.

For details of our what we need where a property has been converted into flats or is part of a purpose-built block, see Tenure of flats.

Applications involving a distressed sale, or a sale and leaseback aren't acceptable.

An energy performance certificate (EPC) gives domestic properties an energy-efficiency rating from A to G. The EPC is valid for 10 years. If the property is sold in that time, the EPC can be used by the new owner.

When a site is assessed as suitable for lending, we'll no longer apply an initial cap on our lending exposure. We'll continue to monitor applications (exposure) as the development progresses and might restrict further lending if concerns arise.

There might be a small number of sites where we decide not to lend on because of specific market or site conditions.

If a free valuation is selected as part of a product incentive, the appeal process on the property valuation isn't available.

If you want to appeal the rental valuation on a BTL remortgage application, please contact us.

Properties subject to Local Authority Homes in Multiple Occupation (HMO) licensing might be acceptable, subject to the valuer's assessment of suitability based on our requirements:

Letting criteria

We'll accept a remortgage on an inherited property where the applicant is a beneficiary, but hasn't owned the property for six months.

Probate must have been granted before an application and written confirmation of the inheritance of the property and grant of probate is needed from the customer's conveyancer.

We'll lend if the valuer confirms the property is suitable mortgage security and provides a present condition valuation figure.

To assess the property, the valuer will need a report outlining the issues and a quote from a treatment company. The company must either be a member of the Property Care Association or offer a warranty-backed treatment plan. If treatment is needed, it's often over 3-4 years.

An initial occupancy/new build property is classed as any property being occupied and/or sold for the first time on the open market in its current state. It also includes newly converted and refurbished properties. These will fall into one of the following categories:

The property must have a Building Standards Indemnity Scheme from a warranty provider accepted by Lloyds Banking Group:

For the property to qualify as acceptable for monitoring by a consultant, it must be either:

If the purchase property address changes once a mortgage application has been made, and the customer's original mortgage product has been withdrawn, a new deal from the current range must be selected.

If the property being purchased isn't changing but an amendment is needed to the address keyed, such as the property number or street name, this must be changed by us before completion. Please contact us to make this change.

We can no longer accept re-type/transcription reports from a Generic Mortgage Valuation Report (GMVR) with a valid Home Report.

For further clarification, please contact your BDM.

Sub-sales and back-to-back transactions aren't acceptable.

The current vendor must have owned the property for at least six months before we can accept an application to purchase the property. The exception to this is if the property is inherited and the customer hasn't owned it for six months.

We use the date of registration at the Land Registry to work out the length of ownership.

A back-to-back transaction is a type of sub-sale where the intervening seller buys from the original seller and sells on to the borrower on the same day or within a few days. We also class cases where the seller acquires the freehold - or superior leasehold - title to the property, and immediately sells on to the borrower by grant of lease or sub-lease as sub-sales.

We'll accept the property being sold on within six months of acquisition where sales are by:

The conveyancer will be responsible for making sure the application meets the acceptable criteria.

Applications involving assignable contracts or irrevocable powers of attorney in favour of intervening sellers aren't acceptable. You should tell us about any other transaction structure with a similar effect.

Freehold and leasehold houses are acceptable. Leasehold properties must have a minimum of 70 years left on the lease at application.

If a property's been converted into no more than four units or is within a purpose-built block, any leases should already be in place and not created at the same time as the mortgage application.

We'll consider lending in these situations:

Tenure is leasehold and the applicant does not own the freehold or share of freehold:

Tenure is leasehold and the applicant owns/will own the freehold of the whole building on completion:

Tenure is leasehold and the applicant owns / will own on completion a share of the freehold of the whole building:

Tenure is freehold:

For developments of more than four units:

The following property types aren't acceptable as security:

The minimum acceptable property value or purchase price is  50,000 - whichever is the lower.

A mortgage valuation is valid for 12 months. If a mortgage doesn't complete within 12 months of the valuation being carried out, a new valuation will be needed. We'll advise you if a new valuation fee is also needed.

We can't accept further advance applications if a mortgage has been at least one month in arrears within the last three months.

You'll need to advise the customer to bring their account up-to-date with no arrears for at least three months before re-applying.

Standalone product transfers can be processed as soon as the account is up to date without the need to wait three months.

Some of our products have early repayment charges (ERCs). These will apply if your customer repays some or all of their mortgage in the ERC period.

For mortgage products with ERCs, up to 10% of the amount outstanding can be repaid without having to pay an ERC. We'll use their balance as of 01 January of the current calendar year to work this out. We can change or withdraw this at any time.

On a porting application, any ERC, which might apply will be waived or refunded if the ERC period ends in the next three months.

On a product transfer application, any ERC which might apply will be waived or refunded if the ERC period ends in the next four months.

You can't start a product transfer application more than four months before the ERC period ends.

If the account has multiple sub-accounts with different ERC periods, you can only complete a product transfer application on the sub-account with the ERC expiring the soonest.

Once the application has been submitted and the new product has started, you'll be able to apply for a product transfer on the other sub-accounts. Instead, you can wait until the ERC on all sub-accounts have three months left until expiry and apply for a product transfer application on all eligible sub-accounts.

For product transfers and further advances, ERCs will be charged on any overpayments made over the 10%, even if the customer is within four months of the ERC expiry.

The minimum further advance amount is  5,000.

When applying for a further advance, the product chosen must be from the same scheme as the main borrowing - BTL or LTB.

We do not accept further advance applications where the EPC rating is F, G or an exemption is in place, except when the purpose of loan is for BTL repairs.

Further advances can't be taken within 6 months of completion of the original mortgage.

A further advance must have completed at least 12 months ago before a new further advance application can be taken.

Arrears

If the customer hasn't made their normal monthly payment and is in arrears, they can't apply for a further advance until the arrears have been cleared. Their payments must also be made in full, on time for three consecutive months.

A further advance and a product transfer can't be applied for at the same time. If a product transfer application has been applied for, you'll need to wait until the new product has started before the further advance application can be submitted.

If a product transfer application is submitted and subsequently cancelled, you'll need to wait until the 1st of the following month before applying for a further advance application.

Acceptable reasons for a further advance

Making Overpayments | Knowledge Base | Birmingham Midshires

One-off or regular overpayments can be made at any time. If early repayment charges (ERCs) apply to the product, please refer to our ERC section for more details.

Payment holidays aren't allowed.

Any early repayment charges (ERCs) won't have to be paid on existing BTL mortgage products ported to a new application.

If a product is portable, it will be outlined in the original mortgage offer and supporting documentation. You can't port a product to a remortgage application if the property is currently mortgaged. You can port to a remortgage of an unencumbered (mortgage free) property the customer already owns or a new purchase.

Porting to an unencumbered remortgage can only be done using the 'Remortgage own conveyancer' option. You can't select our free legal service.

Where a new application is submitted before redemption of the current mortgage, the product can be ported.

An ERC can also be waived/refunded without porting if:

For more information, please refer to our porting guide.

Product transfers are available for non-regulated buy to let and let to buy customers only. Regulated mortgages, including residential customers and regulated buy to let, such as family buy to let aren't eligible for product transfers.

Once a product transfer's been submitted, an automated eligibility check will be carried out to make sure your customers qualify. If your customers don't pass the eligibility check, you'll see an on-screen message explaining the reason why and what you and/or your customers should do next.

Reasons why customers might fail the eligibility check include:

Product transfers can be submitted at any time in the month. The earliest a product transfer can start is the 1st of the following month.

If your customer is within the last three months of an existing product, you can choose to start the new product early. If you select this option, we'll waive any early repayment charge (ERC). You can also choose to forward date the new product to start after the current product has ended.

If the account has multiple sub-accounts with different ERC periods, you can only complete a product transfer application on the sub-account with the ERC expiring the soonest.

When your customer is within the last 4 months of an existing product, you can choose to select a new product and forward date the new product to start after the current product has ended.

## Lending

Assignable contracts allow the original buyer to sell the property before legal completion, by assigning the contract to buy the property to a new buyer after contracts have been exchanged with the developer.

We can't accept applications involving assignable contracts or irrevocable powers of attorney in favour of intervening sellers. Any similar transaction structure must be reported to us.

Additional information:

New build

You must answer 'Yes' to the credit history question asking if any customer has had a bankruptcy / IVA / debt management arrangement or debt relief order which was:

Or

If a bankruptcy / IVA / debt management arrangement or debt relief order was registered over six years ago and is no longer outstanding, the question can be answered as 'No'.

Additional information:

County Court Judgements (CCJs)

Mortgage arrears

• Registered within the last six years (whether now completed or not).

• Is still outstanding (whenever this was registered).

We offer business buy to lets (BBTL) and consumer buy to lets (CBTL).

A BBTL is a mortgage used to buy or remortgage a property to let to a non-family member or where the majority of the borrowing is for BTL purposes.

A CBTL is where the property wasn't originally purchased for letting, and the customer doesn't let out any other properties. The customer or a family member might have previously lived in the property, for example.

And/or

BBTL mortgages are not regulated and a CBTL mortgage is regulated by the HM Treasury. You'll need Consumer FCA permissions before submitting any CBTL applications.

Customer answers will establish whether the loan is classified as a BBTL or CBTL.

Loan purpose is vital in deciding whether lending will be unregulated BBTL or regulated CBTL. When applying for a remortgage with additional borrowing or a further advance, the loan purposes listed will be available online:

BBTL loan purpose

Consumer Goods/Funds

This list might not be available for every application. Availability of each loan purpose will depend on the circumstances of an individual application.

• The majority of the borrowing is for non-business purposes.

• Buy BTL property freehold.
• Buy land adjacent to BTL property.
• Buy extension of lease to BTL.
• Buy final share being mortgaged.
• BTL repairs.
• BTL loan/BTL deposit.
• Repay existing BTL loan.

• Non BTL debt consolidation.
• Non BTL home improvements.
• Non BTL (residential/second home) loan.
• Repay subsequent charge - clearing bank.
• Repay subsequent charge - non-clearing bank.

We don't accept concessionary purchase applications where the property is being purchased below full market value.

The only exception to this is the purchase of a new build property if the value has increased between agreement to purchase and building completion. Builder incentives are acceptable, subject to our existing criteria.

It's acceptable to purchase a BTL property from a family member, as long as the deposit is sourced from the applicant's own resources and the property is purchased at full market value. We can't accept gifted deposits, even if they're from a different family member to the customer.

BTL properties can't be let to a family member.

Additional information:

Builder cash incentives

Please answer 'Yes' to the credit history question if any customer has had a County Court Judgement (CCJ) or default registered against them, or their business if they're self-employed, within the last six years.

CCJs are generally considered in credit scoring. Background details will be need for the application.

Additional information:

Mortgage arrears

Bankruptcies

All applications will be credit scored. Customers have the right to appeal if an application is declined because it doesn't pass our credit scoring.

Here are the scenarios when an appeal might be successful:

Porting application with no additional borrowing

BFPO Address

The client is in the British Armed Forces and living at a BFPO address.

Victim of fraud

The fraud's been reported to the police and Credit Industry Fraud Avoidance system (CIFAS) and has its own a crime reference number.

Adverse credit data registered in error

An error by Lloyds Banking Group can be proven

If the adverse information has been registered on a non-Lloyds Banking Group product, an appeal can't be submitted. The customer should arrange for their credit file to be corrected before a new application is submitted.

For any scenario outside of these, it's unlikely we'll change our decision.

Read our credit scoring guide

A dependant is anyone who relies on your customer financially. They won't be included on the mortgage or contribute to the monthly payments.

Child and adult dependants need to be captured separately.

Child dependants

These are any children under 18 who the customers are the primary carer for. You should also include any children they're expecting or in the process of adopting. Foster children or any children who have an income they can fully support themselves with don't need to be included.

Child maintenance must be keyed as an outgoing commitment, but the child doesn't need to be included as a dependant.

Adult dependant

An adult dependant is someone not included in the mortgage but is financially reliant on the customer. This could be a spouse/partner, elderly relative, or any grown-up children in full-time education or unemployed.

If the adult dependant doesn't live at the property all of the time, still key this in the adult dependant section.

If the adult dependant doesn't ever live at the property, they must not be keyed as a dependant, but the related costs must be keyed as a total figure in 'Other commitments'.

The source of all customer deposits must be captured, and proof must be retained for all buy to let applications, other than remortgages.

The deposit should come from the customers' own resources. A builder's deposit of up to 5% of the purchase price is allowable on new build property applications if the LTV is 75% or less. The valuer must be aware of any incentive and make a note of it in the valuation report.

For certain applications, you'll need to verify the deposit. Evidence will also be needed if the application needs an underwriter review, and/or a message is displayed at DIP submission and the additional requirements section of the Submit application results screens at full application.

We can't accept the following as deposit sources:

We can accept the following as deposit sources, as long as they can be verified

Equity

If the customer is remortgaging or taking a further advance on an existing property with us, and the funds will be used as a deposit, we'll need to view the funds in an account or an offer guaranteeing the lending.

Gift

Gifted deposits are only acceptable from family. They must be non-repayable. The property can't be let out to, or purchased from, a family member. Evidence of the source of deposit must be kept on record in all cases.

Purchases between family members are acceptable, as long as the property's sold at market value and the buyer is a UK resident. Deposits for these types of sale can't be gifted.

You'll need to provide a signed letter written by the donor within three months of the mortgage application

It must include:

It must confirm:

You must also provide the latest UK bank statement or passbook showing evidence of the deposit funds in the donor's or customers' UK bank account. Alternatively, a letter from the donor's or customers' UK bank confirming the funds are available can be provided.

• Answer 'Yes' for all applicants to 'Is the property to be mortgaged, mortgage free?'.

Lending amounts are either assessed using actual or anticipated rental income from the property only using stress rates and rental cover ratios or top slicing where we will consider personal income alongside rental income.

Additional information:

A portfolio landlord application is where the applicants' have four or more mortgaged BTL properties, including the new transaction. This is based on the total number held by everyone named on the application.

Here's an example of how it works

Two applicants are buying a property together. Applicant 1 already has two mortgaged BTL properties, and applicant 2 has one mortgaged BTL property.

In total, they'll have four properties between them, including the one they're buying together, so the application is classified as a portfolio landlord.

Mortgaged BTL properties include those held in a personal name, limited company name, or any other legal entity.

Information needed includes:

Your application will not progress until all of the above has been fully completed - including completion of the portfolio details screen in the full application.

Portfolio landlords criteria

* Based on the entire portfolio, including acquiring property and any unencumbered let property.

Unencumbered let properties

These aren't included in the total mortgaged BTL properties. But the rent and property value must be declared in the property schedule and portfolio details sections of the application.

Since 06 April 2020, tax relief on finance costs for landlords of residential properties is restricted to basic rate of income tax, regardless of which tax band the landlord falls into. Accordingly, profit from land and property as it appears on a tax calculation no longer has finance costs deducted.

You'll need to input the latest year's finance costs on the application.

Examples of builder cash incentives include deposit contributions, cash-backs, contribution to legal fees/stamp duty, and mortgage subsidies.

Builder cash incentives are usually acceptable if their value isn't more than 5% of the lower of the purchase price or valuation. Cash incentives more than this might mean a lower maximum loan amount is available.

All builder cash incentives must be declared at the point of sale. All lending decisions are based on either the valuation or purchase price, whichever is lower.

Additional information:

New build

The buy to let property address must not be the same as the customers' correspondence address.

Properties in England and Wales

Properties in buildings five storeys or higher no longer need an External Wall System (EWS1) form in order to progress an application. We'll also consider applications on properties where cladding remediation work is needed but not yet completed.

EWS1 forms might still be needed for buildings four storeys or lower. The surveyor will advise when an External Wall System (EWS1) form is required to confirm the status of the external wall system and any applicable attachments e.g. balconies on multi occupied, multi storey buildings of any height.

Properties in Scotland and Northern Ireland

Will still need an EWS1 form regardless of height. Customers will have to source the EWS1 form themselves.

The building owner and/or agent is responsible for confirming an external wall system or attachments, such as a balcony, on buildings containing flats has been assessed by a suitable expert.

The EWS1 form must be prepared by a qualified independent professional. They must be a member of one of the professional bodies listed by RICS.

We can't confirm if a property is acceptable until a valuation has been instructed.

For purchase cases, a special condition will be added to a mortgage offer to instruct the conveyancer to advise the customer an offer has been made based on the information in an EWS1. It'll also make sure the customer knows neither us nor the surveyor are liable for information in the EWS1 form.

New build high rise blocks

In England and Wales, The Building (Amendment) Regulations 2018 or local equivalent can be used for new builds over six storeys or 18 metres high. A conveyancer will need to confirm this has been used by the building owner or agent.

This applies to new builds of four storeys or 11 metres high in Scotland.

If this can't be confirmed, please follow the EWS1 process.

The property must be habitable, readily lettable or saleable, and structurally sound.

Buildings insurance also needs to be able to be arranged on it.

The property must be in the UK under UK legal jurisdiction. Property acceptability is based on a satisfactory valuation report from the bank's appointed valuer.

Non-standard construction will be assessed on individual merit.

Certain types of pre-cast reinforced concrete (PRC) construction are classed as defective. We might not accept it unless it's been repaired.

We'll be guided by the suitability of all mortgage properties by the valuer.

For details of our what we need where a property has been converted into flats or is part of a purpose-built block, see Tenure of flats.

• Adjoining property purchases are acceptable, subject to valuer's comments.
• Houseboats and mobile homes/park homes aren't acceptable.
• Properties with annexes are acceptable as long as the annexe forms part of the main title. There should also be no separate tenancy agreement in place for the annexe.
• Studio flats are acceptable subject to valuer's comments. There is no minimum size requirement.
• Right to Buy/Shared ownership applications aren't acceptable.
• If a flat is part of a conversion, where the total number of flats in the scheme is above eight, the valuer must confirm the whole conversion project has been or will be completed to a high standard.
• Flats above/next to a business owned by the same person aren't acceptable.
• Flats above/next to a business not owned by the same person are subject to valuer's comments.

Applications involving a distressed sale, or a sale and leaseback aren't acceptable.

An energy performance certificate (EPC) gives domestic properties an energy-efficiency rating from A to G. The EPC is valid for 10 years. If the property is sold in that time, the EPC can be used by the new owner.

• Properties in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales must have a valid EPC rating of E or above.
• Purchase, remortgage, and Let to Buy applications on properties with F or G EPC ratings are only allowed where a registered exemption is in place.
• We do not accept further advance applications where the EPC rating is F, G or an exemption is in place, except when the purpose of loan is for BTL repairs.
• Product transfers are exempt.
• For new build properties, use the Predicted Energy Assessment (PEA) or Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP) rating if no EPC is available.
• If a property is exempt, evidence isn't needed unless we request it.
• Evidence of EPC, PEA, SAP, or exemption evidence should be kept on file.

When a site is assessed as suitable for lending, we'll no longer apply an initial cap on our lending exposure. We'll continue to monitor applications (exposure) as the development progresses and might restrict further lending if concerns arise.

There might be a small number of sites where we decide not to lend on because of specific market or site conditions.

If a free valuation is selected as part of a product incentive, the appeal process on the property valuation isn't available.

If you want to appeal the rental valuation on a BTL remortgage application, please contact us.

Properties subject to Local Authority Homes in Multiple Occupation (HMO) licensing might be acceptable, subject to the valuer's assessment of suitability based on our requirements:

Additional information:

Letting criteria

• The maximum number of unrelated tenants is five. They must all be named on the agreement. It's the landlords' responsibility to make sure all legislation is complied with, including (but not restricted to) legislation relating to Tenancy Deposit schemes and HMOs.
• The property must be suitable for standard residential occupation.
• Institutional type properties, for example hostel accommodation/bedsits/shared accommodation comparable to halls of residence, aren't acceptable.
• For larger properties, where there is a potential of more than five lettable rooms, the valuer must be satisfied the property and local market reflects single family letting arrangements.
• The property can be let on a single assured shorthold tenancy in England and Wales, a private residential tenancy in Scotland, and a private tenancy in Northern Ireland. The tenancy in Northern Ireland must comply with the provisions of the Private Tenancies (Northern Ireland) Order 2006.

We'll accept a remortgage on an inherited property where the applicant is a beneficiary, but hasn't owned the property for six months.

Probate must have been granted before an application and written confirmation of the inheritance of the property and grant of probate is needed from the customer's conveyancer.

We'll lend if the valuer confirms the property is suitable mortgage security and provides a present condition valuation figure.

To assess the property, the valuer will need a report outlining the issues and a quote from a treatment company. The company must either be a member of the Property Care Association or offer a warranty-backed treatment plan. If treatment is needed, it's often over 3-4 years.

An initial occupancy/new build property is classed as any property being occupied and/or sold for the first time on the open market in its current state. It also includes newly converted and refurbished properties. These will fall into one of the following categories:

The property must have a Building Standards Indemnity Scheme from a warranty provider accepted by Lloyds Banking Group:

For the property to qualify as acceptable for monitoring by a consultant, it must be either:

• Newly built property.
• Refurbished property. These are usually as initial occupancy where the vendor is a builder/developer and the property has been vacated, so it can be refurbished.
• Newly converted property. An example of this is a barn or warehouse converted into residential flats or houses.
• A property, either new or converted, that's been tenanted and is now offered for sale for the first time on the open market by the builder/developer.

• ABC+.
• Advantage HCI.
• ARK Insurance.
• Building LifePlans Ltd (BLP).
• Buildzone.
• Checkmate.
• Global Home Warranties.
• HomeProof (previously Aedis).
• International Construction Warranties (ICW).
• NHBC.
• One Guarantee.
• Premier Guarantee - includes the LABC New Homes Warranty and LABC Hallmark.
• Protek.
• Q Assure Build.

• A single detached property - either self-built or otherwise - where construction is monitored by a consultant employed directly by the customer.
• A property built by a self-build group, where construction is monitored by a consultant employed by that self-build group.
• A property forming part of a small, solely residential development of not more than 15 units in total, where construction is monitored by a consultant employed by the builder or developer. If flats/maisonettes are involved, each individual flat/maisonette counts as one property. Developments containing more than 15 units need an acceptable form of building standards indemnity.

If the purchase property address changes once a mortgage application has been made, and the customer's original mortgage product has been withdrawn, a new deal from the current range must be selected.

If the property being purchased isn't changing but an amendment is needed to the address keyed, such as the property number or street name, this must be changed by us before completion. Please contact us to make this change.

We can no longer accept re-type/transcription reports from a Generic Mortgage Valuation Report (GMVR) with a valid Home Report.

For further clarification, please contact your BDM.

Sub-sales and back-to-back transactions aren't acceptable.

The current vendor must have owned the property for at least six months before we can accept an application to purchase the property. The exception to this is if the property is inherited and the customer hasn't owned it for six months.

We use the date of registration at the Land Registry to work out the length of ownership.

A back-to-back transaction is a type of sub-sale where the intervening seller buys from the original seller and sells on to the borrower on the same day or within a few days. We also class cases where the seller acquires the freehold - or superior leasehold - title to the property, and immediately sells on to the borrower by grant of lease or sub-lease as sub-sales.

We'll accept the property being sold on within six months of acquisition where sales are by:

The conveyancer will be responsible for making sure the application meets the acceptable criteria.

Applications involving assignable contracts or irrevocable powers of attorney in favour of intervening sellers aren't acceptable. You should tell us about any other transaction structure with a similar effect.

• a personal representative of the registered proprietor
• an institutional mortgagee exercising its power of sale
• a receiver, trustee-in-bankruptcy or liquidator
• a developer or builder selling a property acquired under a part-exchange scheme
• a registered housing provider or housing association exercising a power of sale.

Freehold and leasehold houses are acceptable. Leasehold properties must have a minimum of 70 years left on the lease at application.

If a property's been converted into no more than four units or is within a purpose-built block, any leases should already be in place and not created at the same time as the mortgage application.

We'll consider lending in these situations:

Tenure is leasehold and the applicant does not own the freehold or share of freehold:

Tenure is leasehold and the applicant owns/will own the freehold of the whole building on completion:

Tenure is leasehold and the applicant owns / will own on completion a share of the freehold of the whole building:

Tenure is freehold:

For developments of more than four units:

• The conveyancer will make sure the lease meets our standard requirements.

• Our charge must be registered on the freehold of the whole building and the leasehold interest of the unit. The conveyancer will make sure the lease meets our standard requirements.
• The mortgage must be in the same name as the freehold and leasehold titles. It's not acceptable to hold the freehold in a Ltd company with the customer as sole director, majority shareholder, or with any family member.
• It's only acceptable for the customer to own one unit in the whole building, including any new application.

• Our charge must be registered on the leasehold interest only. The conveyancer will make sure the lease meets our standard requirements.

• The security will be registered on the freehold of the whole building and processed as a freehold house.
• The applicant must own the freehold in their own name.
• The mortgage and freehold title must be in the same name. It's not acceptable to hold the freehold in a Ltd Company with the customer as sole director, majority shareholder, or with any family member.
• All units other than the freehold unit on which we're lending must have a minimum lease of 70 years.
• It's only acceptable for the customer to own one unit in the whole building, including any new applications.

• Tenure must be leasehold.
• A management company must be in place.
• Our customer can hold a share in the management company.
• The conveyancer will make sure arrangements in connection with the management company are acceptable.
• Our mortgage must be registered on the leasehold title.

• Timber or metal framed buildings where the cavity has been retrospectively filled with an insulation material.
• Concrete walls built in Cornwall or Devon before 1950. Or 1960 for postcodes PL12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 22, and 23, where a valuer has recommended a Mundic report, and a concrete test has classified it as class B or C.
• Unrepaired, designated defective properties under the Housing Act 1985, Housing (Scotland) Act 1987, Housing (Northern Ireland) Order 1986.
• Large panel system type lats or maisonette blocks without an acceptable structural appraisal.
• Load bearing panels made of asbestos or gypsum plaster.
• Structurally unsound or uninsurable properties.

• Properties with an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) rating of F or G with no registered exemption in place.

The minimum acceptable property value or purchase price is  50,000 - whichever is the lower.

A mortgage valuation is valid for 12 months. If a mortgage doesn't complete within 12 months of the valuation being carried out, a new valuation will be needed. We'll advise you if a new valuation fee is also needed.

## Existing customer

We can't accept further advance applications if a mortgage has been at least one month in arrears within the last three months.

You'll need to advise the customer to bring their account up-to-date with no arrears for at least three months before re-applying.

Standalone product transfers can be processed as soon as the account is up to date without the need to wait three months.

Some of our products have early repayment charges (ERCs). These will apply if your customer repays some or all of their mortgage in the ERC period.

For mortgage products with ERCs, up to 10% of the amount outstanding can be repaid without having to pay an ERC. We'll use their balance as of 01 January of the current calendar year to work this out. We can change or withdraw this at any time.

On a porting application, any ERC, which might apply will be waived or refunded if the ERC period ends in the next three months.

On a product transfer application, any ERC which might apply will be waived or refunded if the ERC period ends in the next four months.

You can't start a product transfer application more than four months before the ERC period ends.

If the account has multiple sub-accounts with different ERC periods, you can only complete a product transfer application on the sub-account with the ERC expiring the soonest.

Once the application has been submitted and the new product has started, you'll be able to apply for a product transfer on the other sub-accounts. Instead, you can wait until the ERC on all sub-accounts have three months left until expiry and apply for a product transfer application on all eligible sub-accounts.

For product transfers and further advances, ERCs will be charged on any overpayments made over the 10%, even if the customer is within four months of the ERC expiry.

The minimum further advance amount is  5,000.

When applying for a further advance, the product chosen must be from the same scheme as the main borrowing - BTL or LTB.

We do not accept further advance applications where the EPC rating is F, G or an exemption is in place, except when the purpose of loan is for BTL repairs.

Further advances can't be taken within 6 months of completion of the original mortgage.

A further advance must have completed at least 12 months ago before a new further advance application can be taken.

Arrears

If the customer hasn't made their normal monthly payment and is in arrears, they can't apply for a further advance until the arrears have been cleared. Their payments must also be made in full, on time for three consecutive months.

A further advance and a product transfer can't be applied for at the same time. If a product transfer application has been applied for, you'll need to wait until the new product has started before the further advance application can be submitted.

If a product transfer application is submitted and subsequently cancelled, you'll need to wait until the 1st of the following month before applying for a further advance application.

Acceptable reasons for a further advance

Remortgage & Capital raising

Maximum LTV

The total lending on an individual property including new further advance

Where the LTV is over 80% at application based on the current index valuation, a revaluation and revaluation fee will be needed. Lending will be subject to the value and rental figure following the revaluation.

View our current revaluation fees.

• 65% LTV between  1,000,000 and  2,000,000
• 75% LTV up to  1,000,000
• 80% LTV available for lending up to  350,000, including all fees, on EPC rated properties A-C

Making Overpayments | Knowledge Base | Birmingham Midshires

One-off or regular overpayments can be made at any time. If early repayment charges (ERCs) apply to the product, please refer to our ERC section for more details.

Payment holidays aren't allowed.

Any early repayment charges (ERCs) won't have to be paid on existing BTL mortgage products ported to a new application.

If a product is portable, it will be outlined in the original mortgage offer and supporting documentation. You can't port a product to a remortgage application if the property is currently mortgaged. You can port to a remortgage of an unencumbered (mortgage free) property the customer already owns or a new purchase.

Porting to an unencumbered remortgage can only be done using the 'Remortgage own conveyancer' option. You can't select our free legal service.

Where a new application is submitted before redemption of the current mortgage, the product can be ported.

An ERC can also be waived/refunded without porting if:

For more information, please refer to our porting guide.

• a new mortgage is being taken in the last three months of the ERC period of the current product
• you apply for a new application on a new product within three months of an existing BM BTL mortgage being redeemed.

Product transfers are available for non-regulated buy to let and let to buy customers only. Regulated mortgages, including residential customers and regulated buy to let, such as family buy to let aren't eligible for product transfers.

Once a product transfer's been submitted, an automated eligibility check will be carried out to make sure your customers qualify. If your customers don't pass the eligibility check, you'll see an on-screen message explaining the reason why and what you and/or your customers should do next.

Reasons why customers might fail the eligibility check include:

• The account is a regulated mortgage.
• The account is in arrears.
• The account has multiple Direct Debits.
• The account has a payment arrangement in place.
• The tenure of the property information is missing from the account.
• No sub-accounts are available to transfer.
• The account requires a review of the sub-account balances.

Product transfers can be submitted at any time in the month. The earliest a product transfer can start is the 1st of the following month.

If your customer is within the last three months of an existing product, you can choose to start the new product early. If you select this option, we'll waive any early repayment charge (ERC). You can also choose to forward date the new product to start after the current product has ended.

If the account has multiple sub-accounts with different ERC periods, you can only complete a product transfer application on the sub-account with the ERC expiring the soonest.

When your customer is within the last 4 months of an existing product, you can choose to select a new product and forward date the new product to start after the current product has ended.

#### Our process

• Submit all applications online at BM Solutions.
• A question will be asked to find out the number of mortgaged BTLs on the application.
• 3 or less, including the new application, will continue as current process.
• 4-10, including the new application, will need proof of income and supporting documents to be uploaded.
• If mortgaged properties within the portfolio are held in a limited company, we'll need the latest mortgage statement or mortgage offer, if completed in the last 12 months.
• Full information about the portfolio must be keyed.

### Information needed includes:

• Addresses.
• Year built and year of purchase.
• Original purchase price.
• Gross monthly rent.
• Estimated property valuation.
• Whether property is leasehold, managed, and mortgaged.

Your application will not progress until all of the above has been fully completed - including completion of the portfolio details screen in the full application.

Portfolio landlords criteria

• No more than 10 BTL mortgaged properties, including the new application.
• Minimum income of  30,000 each application from employment, self-employment, property portfolio profit, or pension/investment income.
• Maximum aggregate portfolio* of 75% LTV.
• Minimum aggregate portfolio rental cover ratio of 145% stressed at 5.5%.
• Property must meet standard criteria.
• Please check the maximum amount the customer can borrow here

* Based on the entire portfolio, including acquiring property and any unencumbered let property.

Unencumbered let properties

These aren't included in the total mortgaged BTL properties. But the rent and property value must be declared in the property schedule and portfolio details sections of the application.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


#### Finance costs

Since 06 April 2020, tax relief on finance costs for landlords of residential properties is restricted to basic rate of income tax, regardless of which tax band the landlord falls into. Accordingly, profit from land and property as it appears on a tax calculation no longer has finance costs deducted.

You'll need to input the latest year's finance costs on the application.

Portfolio landlord help and support

If you need any help with an application, get in touch with our specialist team. You'll get your own dedicated case handler, who will contact you once you submit your application.

### There might also be other costs to consider, including:

• Transfer of equity.
• Purchasing an additional tranche.
• Additional TTs where a cashback is involved.
• Second charges.
• Possessory title.
• Unregistered land.
• Leasehold properties.

The remortgage service is also available for customers raising capital on a mortgage-free property.

Northern Irish customers

Northern Irish law means solicitors appointed by the lender can't provide any additional services to the customer. So, if a customer needs any additional services, they'll need to instruct another solicitor.

Scottish Properties - closure of Sasine register

The General Register of Sasine closed to standard securities on 01 April 2016. This change only affects remortgaging of Scottish properties on the old Sasine register.

As part of our commitment to make things easier, we'll cover the standard costs for transferring from the Sasine register to the Land Registry during the conveyancing part of our remortgage service, wherever possible.

We won't cover all transactions as part of this service if we think they're too complex. For these complex cases, the conveyancer should discuss the additional fees with the customer.

Complex transactions include, but aren't limited to:

• Plans report shows either an overlap or shortfall between the legal and occupational extent.
• The title is complex with split-off writs, exceptions, and additions that need a full examination to draft the security and obtain a relevant deed plan.
• The property is a flat or part of a tenement block with common parts where obtaining neighbouring titles would be needed.
• Rural properties where copies of neighbouring titles are needed to check servitudes/access rights etc.

These are high-level examples considered by conveyancer panel firms as the most likely to happen but aren't the only examples. The specific costs associated with complex transactions will vary. Panel firms will apply an hourly rate and agree everything with customers before starting any complex transaction.

### Single ID&V

For face-to-face verification, where the customer is physically present and documentation is taken and verified, one document from the single identification list can be used to verify the customer.

Single ID can't be used if the customer isn't present when ID&V is collected. This includes video interviews. In this case, use the standard ID&V process.

### Single ID&V documents:

• UK photo card driving licence, showing the customer's current address.
• UK passport.
• Some EU/EEA identity cards.
• Some non-UK passports.

These documents can be accepted in a former name with evidence of the name change, such as a marriage certificate, Deed Poll or Decree Absolute.

Standard ID&V

Standard ID&V must be followed when the customer isn't present when ID&V is obtained, or the customer doesn't have a single ID document.

The customer will need to produce two separate documents. These must be originals and can only be used once in the process for either address verification or identification.

FCA registered firms must make sure any documentation relied upon to verify a customer's identify is copied, certified, and retained in accordance with money laundering regulations. We reserve the right to contact you and request copies of identity documents at any time during the life of the mortgage and for up to five years after cessation.

### IT and other contractors

For IT contractors on any income and other contractors whose income is more than  500 per day or  75,000 per annum, whether employed or self-employed, we accept the gross value of the contract as evidence of income. All applicants must have a current continuous employment of 12 months or more with six months of the contract remaining or two years continuous service in the same type of employment.

The customer should be treated as self-employed if they have more than one contract, or where they've set up a limited company and employ other contractors.

Construction Industry Scheme Contractors (CIS)

For these customers, they'll need to provide an average of their latest 3 months income. They should be treated as self-employed if they pay their own tax or sub-contract to more than one company.

Zero-hours contracts

Applications from customers employed on a zero-hours contract will be considered. We'll only take income from the total of the last 12 calendar months into account income. Applicants will have to verify their income.

Professional sports people

Professional sports people will have to confirm they've either been in continuous employment for 12 months or more with six months of the contract remaining, or two years' continuous service as at the date of application in the same type of employment.

It's essential to verify these customers will be able to meet their monthly repayments as they near the end of their career or if their career's ended early because of injury.

### If any of the following applies, the applicant must be keyed as self-employed:

• They have a shareholding of 25% or more.
• If joint applicants both own a percentage share of 25% or more between them, treat them both as self-employed.
• A sub-contractor who earns income from more than one contract.
• They have a partnership interest in a business where income is not PAYE, regardless of the percentage shareholding.
• They own a franchise.
• They're employed by a private limited company (LTD) and receive a salary (PAYE) and dividends as part of their remuneration package.
• They're in a limited liability partnership (LLP) and receive a share of net profits.

All self-employed income must be entered in the 'Net profit' field, except profit from UK Land & Property, which needs to be captured in the Land and property income section.

### The net profit field should be completed as following:

• Limited company - key total of salary/remuneration and dividends drawn as shown on tax calculation.
• Partnership or LLP - key profit share percentage.
• Sole trader - key net profits.

### Documentation needed:

• Latest 2 years' HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) tax calculations and tax year overviews showing years and the applicants' name/initials.

Tax calculations are available in the applicants online self-assessment account. If they use these, the following details must be visible:

• HMRC logo.
• Unique Tax Reference (UTR).
• Tax year where the most recent is no older than 18 months old.
• Official wording that says: 'This is a copy of information held on your official online SA tax account with HMRC', and 'Submission is 100% complete.'

Online tax assessments from accountants' commercial software, accompanied by the corresponding tax year overviews are acceptable as long as they show:

• UTR.
• Customer's name.
• Tax year where the most recent is no older than 18 months old.

The tax due figure on the tax calculation and tax year overview will usually match. If there is a difference in the tax figure, we might need updated documents.

The latest two years' full accounts must be finalised and clearly show the net profit for sole traders, the share of net profit for partnerships, or salary and dividends for directors of limited companies.

Profit and loss statements alone aren't acceptable.

The year end for all documents must be the most recent and not be dated more than 18 months before the date of application.

### And/or

• The majority of the borrowing is for non-business purposes.

BBTL mortgages are not regulated and a CBTL mortgage is regulated by the HM Treasury. You'll need Consumer FCA permissions before submitting any CBTL applications.

Customer answers will establish whether the loan is classified as a BBTL or CBTL.

Loan purpose is vital in deciding whether lending will be unregulated BBTL or regulated CBTL. When applying for a remortgage with additional borrowing or a further advance, the loan purposes listed will be available online:

BBTL loan purpose

• Buy BTL property freehold.
• Buy land adjacent to BTL property.
• Buy extension of lease to BTL.
• Buy final share being mortgaged.
• BTL repairs.
• BTL loan/BTL deposit.
• Repay existing BTL loan.

Consumer Goods/Funds

• Non BTL debt consolidation.
• Non BTL home improvements.
• Non BTL (residential/second home) loan.
• Repay subsequent charge - clearing bank.
• Repay subsequent charge - non-clearing bank.

This list might not be available for every application. Availability of each loan purpose will depend on the circumstances of an individual application.

BFPO Address

The client is in the British Armed Forces and living at a BFPO address.

Victim of fraud

The fraud's been reported to the police and Credit Industry Fraud Avoidance system (CIFAS) and has its own a crime reference number.

Adverse credit data registered in error

An error by Lloyds Banking Group can be proven

If the adverse information has been registered on a non-Lloyds Banking Group product, an appeal can't be submitted. The customer should arrange for their credit file to be corrected before a new application is submitted.

For any scenario outside of these, it's unlikely we'll change our decision.

### Child dependants

These are any children under 18 who the customers are the primary carer for. You should also include any children they're expecting or in the process of adopting. Foster children or any children who have an income they can fully support themselves with don't need to be included.

Child maintenance must be keyed as an outgoing commitment, but the child doesn't need to be included as a dependant.

Adult dependant

An adult dependant is someone not included in the mortgage but is financially reliant on the customer. This could be a spouse/partner, elderly relative, or any grown-up children in full-time education or unemployed.

If the adult dependant doesn't live at the property all of the time, still key this in the adult dependant section.

If the adult dependant doesn't ever live at the property, they must not be keyed as a dependant, but the related costs must be keyed as a total figure in 'Other commitments'.

Self-employed/contractors

All self-employed income must be entered in 'Net profit' to calculate the correct affordability. It's important to enter turnover and gross profit if the customer has them. If they don't have or know these figures, please enter  '0'.

For contractors who earn more than  500 per day or  75,000 a year, the gross value of their contract is calculated as either:

• daily rate on the contract x 5 days per week x 46 weeks per year
• hourly rate x 7 hours per day x 5 days per week x 46 weeks per year.

If their contract states their hours are lower than these, please use the figures provided.

## Applicants

### If any of the following applies, the applicant must be keyed as self-employed:

• They have a shareholding of 25% or more.
• If joint applicants both own a percentage share of 25% or more between them, treat them both as self-employed.
• A sub-contractor who earns income from more than one contract.
• They have a partnership interest in a business where income is not PAYE, regardless of the percentage shareholding.
• They own a franchise.
• They're employed by a private limited company (LTD) and receive a salary (PAYE) and dividends as part of their remuneration package.
• They're in a limited liability partnership (LLP) and receive a share of net profits.

All self-employed income must be entered in the 'Net profit' field, except profit from UK Land & Property, which needs to be captured in the Land and property income section.

### The net profit field should be completed as following:

• Limited company - key total of salary/remuneration and dividends drawn as shown on tax calculation.
• Partnership or LLP - key profit share percentage.
• Sole trader - key net profits.

### Documentation needed:

• Latest 2 years' HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) tax calculations and tax year overviews showing years and the applicants' name/initials.

Tax calculations are available in the applicants online self-assessment account. If they use these, the following details must be visible:

• HMRC logo.
• Unique Tax Reference (UTR).
• Tax year where the most recent is no older than 18 months old.
• Official wording that says: 'This is a copy of information held on your official online SA tax account with HMRC', and 'Submission is 100% complete.'

Online tax assessments from accountants' commercial software, accompanied by the corresponding tax year overviews are acceptable as long as they show:

• UTR.
• Customer's name.
• Tax year where the most recent is no older than 18 months old.

The tax due figure on the tax calculation and tax year overview will usually match. If there is a difference in the tax figure, we might need updated documents.

The latest two years' full accounts must be finalised and clearly show the net profit for sole traders, the share of net profit for partnerships, or salary and dividends for directors of limited companies.

Profit and loss statements alone aren't acceptable.

The year end for all documents must be the most recent and not be dated more than 18 months before the date of application.

Here's an example of how it works

Two applicants are buying a property together. Applicant 1 already has two mortgaged BTL properties, and applicant 2 has one mortgaged BTL property.

In total, they'll have four properties between them, including the one they're buying together, so the application is classified as a portfolio landlord.

Mortgaged BTL properties include those held in a personal name, limited company name, or any other legal entity.

### Back to top

Assignable contracts allow the original buyer to sell the property before legal completion, by assigning the contract to buy the property to a new buyer after contracts have been exchanged with the developer.

We can't accept applications involving assignable contracts or irrevocable powers of attorney in favour of intervening sellers. Any similar transaction structure must be reported to us.

Mortgage arrears

We offer business buy to lets (BBTL) and consumer buy to lets (CBTL).

A BBTL is a mortgage used to buy or remortgage a property to let to a non-family member or where the majority of the borrowing is for BTL purposes.

A CBTL is where the property wasn't originally purchased for letting, and the customer doesn't let out any other properties. The customer or a family member might have previously lived in the property, for example.

And/or

BBTL mortgages are not regulated and a CBTL mortgage is regulated by the HM Treasury. You'll need Consumer FCA permissions before submitting any CBTL applications.

Customer answers will establish whether the loan is classified as a BBTL or CBTL.

Loan purpose is vital in deciding whether lending will be unregulated BBTL or regulated CBTL. When applying for a remortgage with additional borrowing or a further advance, the loan purposes listed will be available online:

BBTL loan purpose

Consumer Goods/Funds

This list might not be available for every application. Availability of each loan purpose will depend on the circumstances of an individual application.

We don't accept concessionary purchase applications where the property is being purchased below full market value.

The only exception to this is the purchase of a new build property if the value has increased between agreement to purchase and building completion. Builder incentives are acceptable, subject to our existing criteria.

It's acceptable to purchase a BTL property from a family member, as long as the deposit is sourced from the applicant's own resources and the property is purchased at full market value. We can't accept gifted deposits, even if they're from a different family member to the customer.

BTL properties can't be let to a family member.

Please answer 'Yes' to the credit history question if any customer has had a County Court Judgement (CCJ) or default registered against them, or their business if they're self-employed, within the last six years.

CCJs are generally considered in credit scoring. Background details will be need for the application.

Additional information:

Mortgage arrears

Bankruptcies

All applications will be credit scored. Customers have the right to appeal if an application is declined because it doesn't pass our credit scoring.

Here are the scenarios when an appeal might be successful:

Porting application with no additional borrowing

BFPO Address

The client is in the British Armed Forces and living at a BFPO address.

Victim of fraud

The fraud's been reported to the police and Credit Industry Fraud Avoidance system (CIFAS) and has its own a crime reference number.

Adverse credit data registered in error

An error by Lloyds Banking Group can be proven

If the adverse information has been registered on a non-Lloyds Banking Group product, an appeal can't be submitted. The customer should arrange for their credit file to be corrected before a new application is submitted.

For any scenario outside of these, it's unlikely we'll change our decision.

Read our credit scoring guide

A dependant is anyone who relies on your customer financially. They won't be included on the mortgage or contribute to the monthly payments.

Child and adult dependants need to be captured separately.

Child dependants

These are any children under 18 who the customers are the primary carer for. You should also include any children they're expecting or in the process of adopting. Foster children or any children who have an income they can fully support themselves with don't need to be included.

Child maintenance must be keyed as an outgoing commitment, but the child doesn't need to be included as a dependant.

Adult dependant

An adult dependant is someone not included in the mortgage but is financially reliant on the customer. This could be a spouse/partner, elderly relative, or any grown-up children in full-time education or unemployed.

If the adult dependant doesn't live at the property all of the time, still key this in the adult dependant section.

If the adult dependant doesn't ever live at the property, they must not be keyed as a dependant, but the related costs must be keyed as a total figure in 'Other commitments'.

The source of all customer deposits must be captured, and proof must be retained for all buy to let applications, other than remortgages.

The deposit should come from the customers' own resources. A builder's deposit of up to 5% of the purchase price is allowable on new build property applications if the LTV is 75% or less. The valuer must be aware of any incentive and make a note of it in the valuation report.

For certain applications, you'll need to verify the deposit. Evidence will also be needed if the application needs an underwriter review, and/or a message is displayed at DIP submission and the additional requirements section of the Submit application results screens at full application.

We can't accept the following as deposit sources:

Equity

If the customer is remortgaging or taking a further advance on an existing property with us, and the funds will be used as a deposit, we'll need to view the funds in an account or an offer guaranteeing the lending.

Gift

Gifted deposits are only acceptable from family. They must be non-repayable. The property can't be let out to, or purchased from, a family member. Evidence of the source of deposit must be kept on record in all cases.

Purchases between family members are acceptable, as long as the property's sold at market value and the buyer is a UK resident. Deposits for these types of sale can't be gifted.

You'll need to provide a signed letter written by the donor within three months of the mortgage application

It must include:

Sole applications

The applicant must own a property in the UK in their own name. This will need to be validated before an offer can be made.

More than one applicant

At least one applicant must own a property in the UK in their own name. This will need to be validated before an offer can be made. All other named applicants can be first time buyers.

In most cases, we'll validate property ownership with a credit search on the applicant. If we can't do this or the property is unencumbered, we might ask for more evidence.

Acceptable documents:

England and Wales

Scotland and Northern Ireland

The property can be let on:

The minimum tenancy term is six months. The maximum tenancy term is normally 36 months. A maximum tenancy of five years is acceptable under a Dept for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC) model agreement of September 2014 (or as amended) or the Scottish Equivalent.

A BTL remortgage application can't be started without a tenant in place. A tenancy agreement must also be in place. If a tenancy is about to start, the applicant must have a tenancy agreement dated within 14 days of the application confirming the expected rental income.

The property can be let to a company on a corporate let. The maximum term for this is 12 months. Our consent isn't needed to renew the tenancy. But the occupiers need to be named on the tenancy and must be employees of the tenant company.

The maximum number of unrelated tenants is five. They must all be named on the agreement. It's the landlords' responsibility to make sure all legislation is complied with, including (but not restricted to) legislation relating to Tenancy Deposit schemes and HMOs (Houses in Multiple Occupation).

For larger properties, where there is a potential of more than five lettable rooms, the valuer must be satisfied the property and local market reflects single family letting arrangements.

Properties subject to Local Authority Homes in Multiple Occupation (HMO) licensing might be acceptable, subject to the valuer's assessment of suitability based on our requirements.

We can't accept tenants in the following categories:

The tenancy agreement must provide that assignment or sub-lettings to tenants in these categories are not allowed.

Additional information:

A portfolio landlord application is where the applicants' have four or more mortgaged BTL properties, including the new transaction. This is based on the total number held by everyone named on the application.

Here's an example of how it works

Two applicants are buying a property together. Applicant 1 already has two mortgaged BTL properties, and applicant 2 has one mortgaged BTL property.

In total, they'll have four properties between them, including the one they're buying together, so the application is classified as a portfolio landlord.

Mortgaged BTL properties include those held in a personal name, limited company name, or any other legal entity.

Information needed includes:

Your application will not progress until all of the above has been fully completed - including completion of the portfolio details screen in the full application.

Portfolio landlords criteria

* Based on the entire portfolio, including acquiring property and any unencumbered let property.

Unencumbered let properties

These aren't included in the total mortgaged BTL properties. But the rent and property value must be declared in the property schedule and portfolio details sections of the application.

Since 06 April 2020, tax relief on finance costs for landlords of residential properties is restricted to basic rate of income tax, regardless of which tax band the landlord falls into. Accordingly, profit from land and property as it appears on a tax calculation no longer has finance costs deducted.

You'll need to input the latest year's finance costs on the application.

New build

The buy to let property address must not be the same as the customers' correspondence address.

Properties in England and Wales

Properties in buildings five storeys or higher no longer need an External Wall System (EWS1) form in order to progress an application. We'll also consider applications on properties where cladding remediation work is needed but not yet completed.

EWS1 forms might still be needed for buildings four storeys or lower. The surveyor will advise when an External Wall System (EWS1) form is required to confirm the status of the external wall system and any applicable attachments e.g. balconies on multi occupied, multi storey buildings of any height.

Properties in Scotland and Northern Ireland

Will still need an EWS1 form regardless of height. Customers will have to source the EWS1 form themselves.

The building owner and/or agent is responsible for confirming an external wall system or attachments, such as a balcony, on buildings containing flats has been assessed by a suitable expert.

The EWS1 form must be prepared by a qualified independent professional. They must be a member of one of the professional bodies listed by RICS.

We can't confirm if a property is acceptable until a valuation has been instructed.

For purchase cases, a special condition will be added to a mortgage offer to instruct the conveyancer to advise the customer an offer has been made based on the information in an EWS1. It'll also make sure the customer knows neither us nor the surveyor are liable for information in the EWS1 form.

New build high rise blocks

In England and Wales, The Building (Amendment) Regulations 2018 or local equivalent can be used for new builds over six storeys or 18 metres high. A conveyancer will need to confirm this has been used by the building owner or agent.

This applies to new builds of four storeys or 11 metres high in Scotland.

If this can't be confirmed, please follow the EWS1 process.

The property must be habitable, readily lettable or saleable, and structurally sound.

Buildings insurance also needs to be able to be arranged on it.

The property must be in the UK under UK legal jurisdiction. Property acceptability is based on a satisfactory valuation report from the bank's appointed valuer.

Non-standard construction will be assessed on individual merit.

Certain types of pre-cast reinforced concrete (PRC) construction are classed as defective. We might not accept it unless it's been repaired.

We'll be guided by the suitability of all mortgage properties by the valuer.

For details of our what we need where a property has been converted into flats or is part of a purpose-built block, see Tenure of flats.

Applications involving a distressed sale, or a sale and leaseback aren't acceptable.

An energy performance certificate (EPC) gives domestic properties an energy-efficiency rating from A to G. The EPC is valid for 10 years. If the property is sold in that time, the EPC can be used by the new owner.

When a site is assessed as suitable for lending, we'll no longer apply an initial cap on our lending exposure. We'll continue to monitor applications (exposure) as the development progresses and might restrict further lending if concerns arise.

There might be a small number of sites where we decide not to lend on because of specific market or site conditions.

If a free valuation is selected as part of a product incentive, the appeal process on the property valuation isn't available.

If you want to appeal the rental valuation on a BTL remortgage application, please contact us.

Properties subject to Local Authority Homes in Multiple Occupation (HMO) licensing might be acceptable, subject to the valuer's assessment of suitability based on our requirements:

Letting criteria

We'll accept a remortgage on an inherited property where the applicant is a beneficiary, but hasn't owned the property for six months.

Probate must have been granted before an application and written confirmation of the inheritance of the property and grant of probate is needed from the customer's conveyancer.

We'll lend if the valuer confirms the property is suitable mortgage security and provides a present condition valuation figure.

To assess the property, the valuer will need a report outlining the issues and a quote from a treatment company. The company must either be a member of the Property Care Association or offer a warranty-backed treatment plan. If treatment is needed, it's often over 3-4 years.

An initial occupancy/new build property is classed as any property being occupied and/or sold for the first time on the open market in its current state. It also includes newly converted and refurbished properties. These will fall into one of the following categories:

The property must have a Building Standards Indemnity Scheme from a warranty provider accepted by Lloyds Banking Group:

For the property to qualify as acceptable for monitoring by a consultant, it must be either:

If the purchase property address changes once a mortgage application has been made, and the customer's original mortgage product has been withdrawn, a new deal from the current range must be selected.

If the property being purchased isn't changing but an amendment is needed to the address keyed, such as the property number or street name, this must be changed by us before completion. Please contact us to make this change.

We can no longer accept re-type/transcription reports from a Generic Mortgage Valuation Report (GMVR) with a valid Home Report.

For further clarification, please contact your BDM.

Sub-sales and back-to-back transactions aren't acceptable.

The current vendor must have owned the property for at least six months before we can accept an application to purchase the property. The exception to this is if the property is inherited and the customer hasn't owned it for six months.

We use the date of registration at the Land Registry to work out the length of ownership.

A back-to-back transaction is a type of sub-sale where the intervening seller buys from the original seller and sells on to the borrower on the same day or within a few days. We also class cases where the seller acquires the freehold - or superior leasehold - title to the property, and immediately sells on to the borrower by grant of lease or sub-lease as sub-sales.

We'll accept the property being sold on within six months of acquisition where sales are by:

The conveyancer will be responsible for making sure the application meets the acceptable criteria.

Applications involving assignable contracts or irrevocable powers of attorney in favour of intervening sellers aren't acceptable. You should tell us about any other transaction structure with a similar effect.

Freehold and leasehold houses are acceptable. Leasehold properties must have a minimum of 70 years left on the lease at application.

If a property's been converted into no more than four units or is within a purpose-built block, any leases should already be in place and not created at the same time as the mortgage application.

We'll consider lending in these situations:

Tenure is leasehold and the applicant does not own the freehold or share of freehold:

Tenure is leasehold and the applicant owns/will own the freehold of the whole building on completion:

Tenure is leasehold and the applicant owns / will own on completion a share of the freehold of the whole building:

Tenure is freehold:

For developments of more than four units:

The following property types aren't acceptable as security:

The minimum acceptable property value or purchase price is  50,000 - whichever is the lower.

A mortgage valuation is valid for 12 months. If a mortgage doesn't complete within 12 months of the valuation being carried out, a new valuation will be needed. We'll advise you if a new valuation fee is also needed.

Standalone product transfers can be processed as soon as the account is up to date without the need to wait three months.

Some of our products have early repayment charges (ERCs). These will apply if your customer repays some or all of their mortgage in the ERC period.

For mortgage products with ERCs, up to 10% of the amount outstanding can be repaid without having to pay an ERC. We'll use their balance as of 01 January of the current calendar year to work this out. We can change or withdraw this at any time.

On a porting application, any ERC, which might apply will be waived or refunded if the ERC period ends in the next three months.

On a product transfer application, any ERC which might apply will be waived or refunded if the ERC period ends in the next four months.

You can't start a product transfer application more than four months before the ERC period ends.

If the account has multiple sub-accounts with different ERC periods, you can only complete a product transfer application on the sub-account with the ERC expiring the soonest.

Once the application has been submitted and the new product has started, you'll be able to apply for a product transfer on the other sub-accounts. Instead, you can wait until the ERC on all sub-accounts have three months left until expiry and apply for a product transfer application on all eligible sub-accounts.

For product transfers and further advances, ERCs will be charged on any overpayments made over the 10%, even if the customer is within four months of the ERC expiry.

The minimum further advance amount is  5,000.

When applying for a further advance, the product chosen must be from the same scheme as the main borrowing - BTL or LTB.

We do not accept further advance applications where the EPC rating is F, G or an exemption is in place, except when the purpose of loan is for BTL repairs.

Further advances can't be taken within 6 months of completion of the original mortgage.

A further advance must have completed at least 12 months ago before a new further advance application can be taken.

Arrears

If the customer hasn't made their normal monthly payment and is in arrears, they can't apply for a further advance until the arrears have been cleared. Their payments must also be made in full, on time for three consecutive months.

A further advance and a product transfer can't be applied for at the same time. If a product transfer application has been applied for, you'll need to wait until the new product has started before the further advance application can be submitted.

If a product transfer application is submitted and subsequently cancelled, you'll need to wait until the 1st of the following month before applying for a further advance application.

Acceptable reasons for a further advance

Remortgage & Capital raising

Maximum LTV

The total lending on an individual property including new further advance

Where the LTV is over 80% at application based on the current index valuation, a revaluation and revaluation fee will be needed. Lending will be subject to the value and rental figure following the revaluation.

View our current revaluation fees.

Making Overpayments | Knowledge Base | Birmingham Midshires

One-off or regular overpayments can be made at any time. If early repayment charges (ERCs) apply to the product, please refer to our ERC section for more details.

Payment holidays aren't allowed.

Any early repayment charges (ERCs) won't have to be paid on existing BTL mortgage products ported to a new application.

If a product is portable, it will be outlined in the original mortgage offer and supporting documentation. You can't port a product to a remortgage application if the property is currently mortgaged. You can port to a remortgage of an unencumbered (mortgage free) property the customer already owns or a new purchase.

Porting to an unencumbered remortgage can only be done using the 'Remortgage own conveyancer' option. You can't select our free legal service.

Where a new application is submitted before redemption of the current mortgage, the product can be ported.

An ERC can also be waived/refunded without porting if:

For more information, please refer to our porting guide.

Product transfers are available for non-regulated buy to let and let to buy customers only. Regulated mortgages, including residential customers and regulated buy to let, such as family buy to let aren't eligible for product transfers.

Once a product transfer's been submitted, an automated eligibility check will be carried out to make sure your customers qualify. If your customers don't pass the eligibility check, you'll see an on-screen message explaining the reason why and what you and/or your customers should do next.

Reasons why customers might fail the eligibility check include:

Product transfers can be submitted at any time in the month. The earliest a product transfer can start is the 1st of the following month.

If your customer is within the last three months of an existing product, you can choose to start the new product early. If you select this option, we'll waive any early repayment charge (ERC). You can also choose to forward date the new product to start after the current product has ended.

If the account has multiple sub-accounts with different ERC periods, you can only complete a product transfer application on the sub-account with the ERC expiring the soonest.

When your customer is within the last 4 months of an existing product, you can choose to select a new product and forward date the new product to start after the current product has ended.
